The UNFCCC aims to stabilize greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level where [[climate change and ecosystems|ecosystems]] can adapt naturally to climate change, [[Effects of climate change on agriculture|food production]] is not threatened, and [[economics of global warming|economic development]] can proceed in a sustainable fashion.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG3 Ch1|2007|p=99}}</ref>
Currently human activities are adding CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it.<ref name="ar4 stabilizing"/>

In 2018, human activities were estimated to have caused approximately 1.0&nbsp;°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8&nbsp;°C to 1.2&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SR15 SPM|2018|p=4}}</ref>

===Needed emissions cuts===
According to the emissions gap report of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] for limiting warming to 1.5&nbsp;°C GHG emissions should be cut from the level of 2020 by 76% by 2030.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cut global emissions by 7.6 percent every year for next decade to meet 1.5°C Paris target - UN report |url=https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/cut-global-emissions-76-percent-every-year-next-decade-meet-15degc |website=United Nations Environmental Programm |date=26 November 2019 |publisher=United Nations |access-date=17 September 2021}}</ref>

A small group of scientists leaked some information on the results of Working Group III (Mitigation of Climate Change) from the [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report]]. As governments can change the summaries for policymakers (SPM) for IPCC reports, the scientists were afraid that politicians might dilute this information in the summary. According to the leaked information, humanity should cut GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 and completely by 2050 with a peak by 2025 in order to limit warming to 1.5&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Fiona |last1=Harvey |first2=Giles |last2=Tremlett |date=12 August 2021 |title=Greenhouse gas emissions must peak within 4 years, says leaked UN report |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/12/greenhouse-gas-emissions-must-peak-within-4-years-says-leaked-un-report |access-date=2 September 2021}}</ref>

According to the [[Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C]] limiting warming below or close to {{convert|1.5|C-change}} would require to decrease net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by around 45% by 2030 from the level of 2010 and reach ''net zero'' by 2050. For limiting global warming to below {{convert|2|C-change}}, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions should decline by 25% by 2030 and by 100% by 2075. Non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions need to be strongly reduced at similar levels in both scenarios.<ref>{{cite book |title=Summary for Policymakers. In: Global Warming of 1.5°C.

In 2022, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) released its [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report|Sixth Assessment Report]] on climate change, warning that greenhouse gas emissions must peak before [[2025]] at the latest and decline 43% by 2030, in order to likely limit global warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F).<ref>{{cite web |title=It's over for fossil fuels: IPCC spells out what's needed to avert climate disaster |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/its-over-for-fossil-fuels-ipcc-spells-out-whats-needed-to-avert-climate-disaster |website=The Guardian |date=4 April 2022 |access-date=4 April 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The evidence is clear: the time for action is now.

=== Carbon reduction ===
Carbon sequestration is the process of storing carbon dioxide in a solid and dissolved forms for very long periods.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Carbon Sequestration |url=https://climatechange.lta.org/carbon-sequestration/ |access-date=2022-04-29 |website=Conservation in a Changing Climate}}</ref> It is a tremendous process which could reduce the anthropogenic carbon footprint at a stable state.<ref>{{Cite web |last=tdus |date=2021-08-21 |title=Carbon Sequestration |url=https://climatechange.ucdavis.edu/climate/definitions/carbon-sequestration |access-date=2022-04-29 |website=UC Davis |language=en}}</ref> However, the cost of the process could be cost inefficient and the safety of the process on other ecological cycles is uncertain.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Farrelly |first1=Damien J. |last2=Everard |first2=Colm D. |last3=Fagan |first3=Colette C. |last4=McDonnell |first4=Kevin P. |date=2013-05-01 |title=Carbon sequestration and the role of biological carbon mitigation: A review |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032112007435 |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |language=en |volume=21 |pages=712–727 |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2012.12.038 |issn=1364-0321}}</ref>

=== Calculations ===
The IPCC works with the concept of a fixed carbon [[emissions budget]]. If emissions remain on the current level of 42 Gt{{CO2}}, the carbon budget for 1.5&nbsp;°C could be exhausted in 2028.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC SR15 Ch2|2018|p=96}}</ref>
The rise in temperature to that level would occur with some delay between 2030 and 2052.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC SR15 Ch1|2018|p=66}}</ref> Even if it was possible to achieve negative emissions in the future, 1.5&nbsp;°C must not be exceeded at any time to avoid the loss of ecosystems.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SR15 SPM|2018|p=5|loc=A.3.2}}</ref>

In the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&nbsp;°C, the IPCC emphasized the benefits of keeping global warming below this level.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC SR15 Technical Summary|2018|p=31}}</ref> Emissions pathways with no or limited overshoot would require rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure including transport and buildings, and industrial systems.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC SR15 SPM|2018|p=15}}</ref> Pathways that aim for limiting warming to 1.5&nbsp;°C by 2100 after a temporary temperature overshoot rely on large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures, which are uncertain and entail clear risks.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC SR15 Technical Summary|2018|p=33}}</ref>

=== Effects ===
[[Climate change mitigation scenarios]] from the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] state that there will be {{Convert|1.5|C-change}} of warming by the end of the 21st century if emissions immediately decline and go to [[Carbon neutrality|net zero]] by 2050.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC SR15|2018|p=12}}</ref> In the other end of the scenarios, there will be a {{Convert|4.8|C-change}} amount of warming if emissions continue upwards until they are triple current levels.

GHG emissions are measured in [[Global warming potential#Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}} equivalents]] determined by their [[global warming potential]] (GWP), which depends on their lifetime in the atmosphere. Estimations largely depend on the ability of oceans and land sinks to absorb these gases.
[[Short-lived climate pollutants]] (SLCPs) including [[methane]], [[Hydrofluorocarbon|hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)]], [[tropospheric ozone]] and [[black carbon]] persist in the atmosphere for a period ranging from days to 15 years as compared to carbon dioxide which can remain in the atmosphere for millennia.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=IGSD|date=2013|title=Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs)|url=http://www.igsd.org/initiatives/slcps/|access-date=29 November 2019|website=Institute of Governance and Sustainable Development (IGSD)}}</ref> Reducing SLCP emissions can cut the ongoing rate of global warming by almost half and reduce the projected Arctic warming by two-thirds.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zaelke|first1=Durwood|last2=Borgford-Parnell|first2=Nathan|last3=Andersen|first3=Stephen|last4=Picolotti|first4=Romina|last5=Clare|first5=Dennis|last6=Sun|first6=Xiaopu|last7=Gabrielle|first7=Danielle|year=2013|title=Primer on Short-Lived Climate Pollutants|url=http://www.igsd.org/documents/PrimeronShort-LivedClimatePollutantsNovemberElectronicversion.pdf|publisher=Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development|pages=3}}</ref>

GHG emissions in 2019 were estimated at 57.4 Gt{{CO2}}e, while {{CO2}} emissions alone made up 42.5 Gt including land-use change (LUC).<ref name="Trends2">using 100 year [[global warming potential]] from IPCC-AR4</ref>

While mitigation measures for decarbonization are essential on the longer-term, they could result in weak near-term warming because sources of carbon emissions often also co-emit air pollution. Hence, pairing measures that target carbon dioxide with measures targeting non-{{CO2}} pollutants – short-lived climate pollutants, which have faster effects on the climate, is essential for climate goals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dreyfus |first1=Gabrielle B. |last2=Xu |first2=Yangyang |last3=Shindell |first3=Drew T. |last4=Zaelke |first4=Durwood |last5=Ramanathan |first5=Veerabhadran |title=Mitigating climate disruption in time: A self-consistent approach for avoiding both near-term and long-term global warming |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=31 May 2022 |volume=119 |issue=22 |pages=e2123536119 |doi=10.1073/pnas.2123536119 |language=en |issn=0027-8424}}</ref>

* '''Human waste and wastewater''' (21%): When biomass waste in landfills and organic substances in domestic and [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] is decomposed by bacteria in anaerobic conditions, substantial amounts of methane are generated.<ref name="Trends12"/>

====F-Gases====
Fluorinated gases include [[halocarbon|hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF<sub>6</sub>), and [[nitrogen trifluoride]] (NF<sub>3</sub>).
They are used by switchgear in the power sector, semiconductor manufacture, aluminium production and a large unknown source of SF<sub>6</sub>.<ref>{{harvnb|Olivier|Peters|2020|p=38}}</ref> Continued phase down of manufacture and use of HFCs under the [[Kigali Amendment]] to the [[Montreal Protocol]] will help reduce HFC emissions and concurrently improve the energy efficiency of appliances that use HFCs like air conditioners, freezers and other refrigeration devices.

====Black carbon====
[[Black carbon]] is formed through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, [[biofuel]], and [[biomass]]. It is not a greenhouse gas but a [[climate forcing]] agent. Black carbon can absorb sunlight and reduce [[albedo]] when deposited on snow and ice. Indirect heating can be caused by the interaction with clouds.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Bounding the role of black carbon in the climate system: A scientific assessment|last = Bond|date = 2013|journal = J.

==Fossil fuel substitution==
{{main|Fossil fuel phase-out}}
{{See|Fossil fuel power station#Conversion of fossil fuel power plants}}

As most greenhouse gas emissions are due to fossil fuels, rapidly phasing out oil, gas and coal is critical. In a system based on fossil fuels, demand is expected to double until 2050. Switching to renewable energy combined with the electrification of transport and heating can lower the primary energy demand significantly.<ref name="LUT"/> Currently, less than 20% of energy is used as electricity.<ref name="IEA"/>

A global transition to [[100% renewable energy]] across all sectors is feasible well before 2050. With dropping prices for wind and solar energy as well as storage, the transition no longer depends on economic viability but is considered as a question of political will.
The [[sustainable energy]] system is more efficient and cost effective than the existing system.<ref name="LUT"/> Operators investing into fossil fuels face a growing risk of [[stranded assets]].<ref>{{cite web

===Low-carbon energy sources===
{{Main|Renewable energy}}
{{See also|Low-carbon economy|Renewable energy commercialization|Renewable energy debate}}

Wind and sun can be sources for large amounts of low-carbon energy at competitive production costs. But even in combination, generation of [[variable renewable energy]] fluctuates a lot. This can be tackled by extending [[super grid|grids]] over large areas with a sufficient capacity or by using [[energy storage]] (see also: [[Grid energy storage#Forms|forms of grid energy storage]]) and [[100% renewable energy#Intermittency management|by other means]]. [[Load management]] of industrial energy consumption can help to balance the production of renewable energy production and its demand. Electricity production by [[biogas]] and [[hydro power]] can [[Load following power plant|follow the energy demand]]. Both can be driven by variable energy prices.

The deployment of [[renewable energy]] would have to be accelerated six-fold though to stay under the 2&nbsp;°C target.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Energy Transformation: A Roadmap to 2050 (2019 edition)|url=https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2019/Apr/IRENA_Global_Energy_Transformation_2019.pdf|publisher=[[International Renewable Energy Agency]]|access-date=29 January 2020}}</ref>

The global [[primary energy]] demand exceeded 161,000 TWh in 2018.<ref name="IEA GECO">{{harvnb|Global Energy & CO2 Status Report|2019}}</ref> This refers to electricity, transport and heating including all losses. In transport and electricity production, fossil fuel usage has a low efficiency of less than 50%. Large amounts of heat in power plants and in motors of vehicles are wasted. The actual amount of energy consumed is significantly lower at 116,000 TWh.<ref name="IEA">{{cite report|title=Key World Energy Statistics 2020|publisher=IEA|url=https://www.iea.org/reports/key-world-energy-statistics-2020/final-consumption|year=2020}}</ref>

The competitiveness of renewable energy is a key to a rapid deployment. In 2020, onshore wind and solar photovoltaics were the cheapest source for new bulk electricity generation in many regions.<ref name="Bloomberg"/> Storage requirements cause additional costs. A [[carbon price]] can increase the competitiveness of renewable energy.

Burning plant-derived [[biomass]] releases {{CO2}}, but it has still been classified as a renewable energy source in the EU and UN legal frameworks because photosynthesis cycles the {{CO2}} back into new crops. How a fuel is produced, transported and processed has a significant impact on lifecycle emissions.

==Energy efficiency and non-fossil fuel storage==
{{Main|Energy storage}}
{{See also|Hydrogen economy}}
Wind energy and photovoltaics can deliver large amounts of electric energy but not at any time and place. One approach is the conversation into storable forms of energy. This generally leads to losses in efficiency. A study by [[Imperial College London]] calculated the lowest levelised cost of different systems for mid-term and seasonal storage. In 2020, [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped hydro]] (PHES), [[Compressed-air energy storage|compressed air]] (CAES) and [[Lithium-ion battery|Li-on batteries]] are most cost effective depending on charging rhythm. For 2040, a more significant role for Li-on and hydrogen is projected.<ref>{{harvnb|Schmidt|Melchior|Hawkes|Staffell|2019}}</ref>

===Super grids===
{{Main|Super grid}}
[[File:DESERTEC-Map large.jpg|thumb|Sketch of a possible super grid. The red squares represent the total surfaces needed for solar collectors of Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) plants to provide the present electricity demands.]] 
Long-distance power lines help to minimize storage requirements. A continental transmission network can smoothen local variations of wind energy. With a global grid, even photovoltaics could be available all day and night. The strongest [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) connections are quoted with losses of only 1.6% per 1000&nbsp;km<ref>{{cite web|title=UHV Grid|url=https://en.geidco.org.cn/aboutgei/uhv/|publisher=Global Energy Interconnection (GEIDCO)|access-date=26 January 2020|archive-date=1 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201182520/https://en.geidco.org/aboutgei/uhv/|url-status=dead}}</ref> with a clear advantage compared to AC.

===Smart grid and load management===
{{Main|Smart grid|Load management}}
Instead of expanding grids and storage for more power, electricity demand can be adjusted on the consumer side. This can flatten demand peaks. Traditionally, the energy system has treated consumer demand as fixed. Instead, data systems can combine with advanced software to pro-actively manage demand and respond to energy market prices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy and Load Management|url=https://arena.gov.au/assets/2018/10/REALM-Industry-Report_public_FINAL.pdf|publisher=UTS University of Technology Sydney|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>

[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] tariffs are a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. On a household level, charging electric vehicles or running heat pumps combined with hot water storage when wind or sun energy are available reduces electricity costs.

[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. Refrigerators or heat pumps can reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits. Smart Scheduling of activities and processes<!--computing, industrial, vehicle recharging, etc.--> can adjust demand to fluctuating supply.<ref>{{cite web |title=Smart scheduling for big computing tasks cuts emissions up to a third |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2295330-smart-scheduling-for-big-computing-tasks-cuts-emissions-up-to-a-third/ |website=New Scientist |access-date=1 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-05-15 |title=Stagger your weekly offs: PSPCL appeals to Punjab industries, issues schedule |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/stagger-your-weekly-offs-pspcl-appeals-to-punjab-industries-issues-schedule-7918105/ |access-date=2022-05-18 |website=The Indian Express |language=en}}</ref>

[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery to supply the grid temporarily.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-06-08|title=UK vehicle-to-grid trial finds economic potential but 'hardware costs still too high'|url=https://www.energy-storage.news/uk-vehicle-to-grid-trial-finds-economic-potential-but-hardware-costs-still-too-high/|access-date=2021-12-24|website=Energy Storage News|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-09-04|title=Electric cars: Ofgem plans easier way for drivers to sell energy back to grid|url=http://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/04/electric-cars-ofgem-plans-easier-way-for-drivers-to-sell-energy-back-to-grid|access-date=2021-12-24|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> Smart grids could also monitor/control residential devices that are noncritical during periods of peak power consumption, and return their function during nonpeak hours.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sayed |first1=K. |last2=Gabbar |first2=H.

Planting new trees can be expensive, especially for the poor who often live in areas of [[deforestation]], and can be a risky investment as, for example, studies in the [[Sahel]] have found that 80 percent of planted trees die within two years. Instead, helping native species sprout naturally is much cheaper and more likely to survive, with even long deforested areas still containing an "underground forest" of living roots and tree stumps that are still able to regenerate. This could include [[pruning]] and [[coppicing]] the tree to accelerate its growth and that also provides [[woodfuel]], a major source of deforestation. Such practices, called [[farmer-managed natural regeneration]], are centuries old but the biggest obstacle towards implementing natural regrowth of trees are legal ownership of the trees by the state, often as a way of selling such timber rights to business people, leading to seedlings being uprooted by locals who saw them as a liability.

====Direct air capture====
{{Main|Direct air capture}}
[[Direct air capture]] is a process of capturing {{co2}} directly from the ambient air (as opposed to capturing from [[Point source pollution|point sources]]) and generating a concentrated stream of {{CO2}} for [[Carbon sequestration|sequestration]] or [[Carbon capture and utilization|utilization]] or production of [[carbon-neutral fuel]] and [[windgas]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Direct Air Capture – Analysis|url=https://www.iea.org/reports/direct-air-capture|access-date=2021-12-24|website=IEA|language=en-GB}}</ref> Artificial processes vary, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of some of these processes.<ref name=RoyalSociety>The Royal Society, (2009) [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=35151 "Geoengineering the climate: science, governance and uncertainty"].

====Enhanced weathering====
[[Enhanced weathering]] is the removal of carbon from the air into the earth, enhancing the natural [[carbon cycle]] where carbon is mineralized into rock. The [[CarbFix]] project couples with carbon capture and storage in power plants to turn carbon dioxide into stone in a relatively short period of two years, addressing the common concern of leakage in CCS projects which stores carbon as a gas instead. While this project used [[basalt]] rocks, [[olivine]] has also shown promise.<ref>{{Cite news|title={{CO2}} turned into stone in Iceland in climate change breakthrough|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 June 2016|access-date= 2 September 2017|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/09/co2-turned-into-stone-in-iceland-in-climate-change-breakthrough}}</ref>

====Shipping====
In the shipping industry, the use of [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) as a marine bunker fuel is driven by emissions regulations.

====Air travel====
In aviation, current 180 Mt of {{CO2}} emissions (11% of emissions in transport) are expected to rise in most projections, at least until 2040. [[Aviation biofuel]] and hydrogen can only cover a small proportion of flights in the coming years. The market entry for hybrid-driven aircraft on regional scheduled flights is projected after 2030, for battery-powered aircraft after 2035.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/aviation-network-decarbonisation-issues|title=The aviation network – Decarbonisation issues|publisher=[[Eurocontrol]]|date=4 September 2019}}</ref>

In October 2016, the 191 nations of the ICAO established the [[Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation]] (CORSIA), requiring operators to purchase [[carbon offset]]s to cover their emissions above 2020 levels, starting from 2021. This is voluntary until 2027. The [[environmental impact of aviation]] increases at high altitudes.

=== Energy ===
Energy consumption will need to be halved by 2050 for avoiding warming of 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels. While this will slow economic growth it will not necessarily lead to a lower life level if it will be done in the right way.<ref>{{cite web |last1=KNIGHT |first1=BEN |title=We must halve our energy use to avoid climate catastrophe: new modelling |url=https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/social-affairs/we-must-halve-our-energy-use-avoid-climate-catastrophe-new-modelling |website=UNSW Sydney |date=28 April 2022 |access-date=6 May 2022}}</ref>

====Heating and cooling====
{{See also|Electric heating}}
The buildings sector accounts for 23% of global energy-related {{CO2}} emissions<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SR15 Ch2|2018|p=141}}</ref> About half of the energy is used for space and water heating.<ref>{{harvnb|IEA ETP Buildings|2017}}</ref>

A combination of electric [[heat pump]]s and [[Zero heating building|building insulation]] can reduce the primary energy demand significantly. Generally, electrification of heating and cooling would only reduce GHG emissions if the electric power comes from low-carbon sources. A fossil-fuel power station may only deliver 3 units of electrical energy for every 10 units of fuel energy released. Electrifying heating and cooling loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]] to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.

====Heat pumps====
[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an [[air source heat pump]]]]
A modern heat pump typically produces around two to six times more thermal energy than electrical energy consumed, giving an effective efficiency of 200 to 600%, depending on the [[coefficient of performance]] and the outside temperature. It uses an electrically driven compressor to operate a [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration cycle]] that extracts heat energy from outdoor air and moves that heat to the space to be warmed. In the summer months, the cycle can be reversed for [[air conditioner|air conditioning]].
In areas with average winter temperatures well below freezing, ground source heat pumps are more efficient than air-source heat pumps. The high purchase price of a heat pump compared to resistance heaters may be offset when air conditioning is also needed.

====Cooling====
{{See also|Passive cooling}}
[[Refrigeration]] and [[air conditioning]] account for about 10% of global {{CO2}} emissions caused by fossil fuel-based energy production and the use of fluorinated gases. Slashing HFC consumption by 80% by midcentury could avoid more than 0.4&nbsp;°C of global warming by the end of the century. About 90% of the emissions occur at the end of the equipment's life. Solutions include investing in proper disposal and refrigerants that are less polluting.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201204-climate-change-how-chemicals-in-your-fridge-warm-the-planet|title=How your fridge is heating up the planet|publisher=BBCnews.com|access-date=16 July 2021|date=7 December 2020}}</ref>

The energy consumption for cooling is expected to rise significantly due to increasing heat and availability of devices in poorer countries. Of the 2.8 billion people living in the hottest parts of the world, only 8% currently have air conditioners, compared with 90% of people in the US and Japan.<ref>{{cite web

A shift to renewable energy in the cooling sector comes with two advantages: Solar energy production with mid-day peaks corresponds with the load required for cooling. Additionally, cooling has a large potential for load management in the electric grid.

====Electric resistant heating====
[[radiant heating|Radiant heaters]] in households are cheap and widespread but less efficient than heat pumps. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common. Large scale hot water tanks can be used for demand-side management and store variable renewable energy over hours or days.

Effective [[urban planning]] to reduce [[urban sprawl|sprawl]] aims to decrease the distance travelled by vehicles, lowering emissions from transportation. Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings. Switching from cars by improving [[walkability]] and [[cycling infrastructure]] is either free or beneficial to a country's economy as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Sixth Carbon Budget Surface Transport|url=https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sector-summary-Surface-transport.pdf|website=[[UKCCC]]|quote=there is zero net cost to the economy of switching from cars to walking and cycling}}</ref>

With full scale mitigation action the emissions will be near zero, in the worst case they will be only 3 [[GtCO2eq|GtCO2-eq]]. City planning, supporting mixed use of space, transit, walking, cycling, sharing vehicles can reduce urban emissions by 23% - 26%. Urban forests, lakes and other blue and green infrastructure can reduce emissions directly and indirectly (trough reduce in energy demand for cooling for example).<ref>{{cite book |title=WORKING GROUP III CONTRIBUTION TO THE IPCC SIXTH ASSESSMENT REPORT (AR6) Technical Summary |publisher=IPCC |pages=61–66 |url=https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg3/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FinalDraft_TechnicalSummary.pdf |access-date=10 April 2022}}</ref>

At the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.

Reducing the number of cars on the road,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2019/jul/03/ten-common-myths-about-bike-lanes-and-why-theyre-wrong |title=Ten common myths about bike lanes – and why they're wrong |website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |date=3 July 2019 |access-date=5 September 2020 |archive-date=8 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808131140/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2019/jul/03/ten-common-myths-about-bike-lanes-and-why-theyre-wrong |url-status=live }}</ref> for example through [[proof-of-parking]] requirements, [[corporate car sharing]], [[road reallocation]] (from only car use to cycling road, ...), [[circulation plan]]s, [[Parallel parking#Legality|bans on on-street parking]] or by increasing the [[costs of car ownership]] can help in reducing [[traffic congestion]] in cities.

Approaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage public transit and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through "medium-density", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.

Smarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns (urban agriculture, urban trees), which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.

Changes in urban form, behavior programs, the circular economy, the shared economy, and digitalization trends can support systemic changes that lead to reductions in demand for transport services or expands the use of more efficient transport modes. Cities can reduce their transport-related fuel consumption by around 25% through combinations of more compact land use and the provision of less car-dependent transport infrastructure. Appropriate infrastructure, including protected pedestrian and bike pathways, can also support much greater localized active travel. Transport demand management incentives are expected to be necessary to support these systemic changes. There is mixed evidence of the effect of circular economy initiatives, shared economy initiatives, and digitalization on demand for transport services. For example, while dematerialization can reduce the amount of material that need to be transported to manufacturing facilities, an increase in online shopping with priority delivery can increase demand for freight transport. Similarly, while teleworking could reduce travel demand, increased ridesharing could increase vehicle-km travelled.<ref>"Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change". www.ipcc.ch.

According to the [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report]] buildings emitted 21% of global GHG emissions in the year 2019. The report introduces a new scheme for reducing GHG emissions in buildings: SER = Sufficiency, Efficiency, Renewable. Sufficiency measures do not need very complex technology, energy supply, maintenance or replacement during the life of the building. Those include, natural ventilation, green roofs, white walls, mixed use of spaces, collective use of devices etc.<ref>{{cite book |title=WORKING GROUP III CONTRIBUTION TO THE IPCC SIXTH ASSESSMENT REPORT (AR6) Technical Summary |publisher=IPCC |pages=71–76 |url=https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg3/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FinalDraft_TechnicalSummary.pdf |access-date=11 April 2022}}</ref> There are multiple links between emissions from buildings and emissions from other sectors including those discussed in chapters 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11 in the report. Reducing GHG emissions from buildings is linked to [[Sharing economy]] and [[Circular economy]].<ref>{{cite book |title=WG III contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report , CHAPTER 9 |date=2022 |publisher=IPCC |pages=10, 49–50 |url=https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg3/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FinalDraft_Chapter09.pdf |access-date=24 April 2022}}</ref>

With strong action to reduce energy consumption of buildings "average energy intensity of the global building stock would decrease by more than 80% by 2050."<ref>{{cite book |title=Towards zero-emission efficient and resilient buildings GLOBAL STATUS REPORT 2016 |date=2016 |publisher=Global Alliance for Buildings and construction |page=8 |url=https://www.worldgbc.org/sites/default/files/GABC_Global_Status_Report_V09_november_FINAL.pdf |access-date=26 April 2022}}</ref>

New buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources. Existing buildings can be made more efficient through the use of insulation, high-efficiency appliances (particularly [[water heating|hot water heaters]] and [[Furnace (house heating)|furnaces]]), [[insulated glazing|double- or triple-glazed gas-filled windows]], external window shades, and building orientation and siting. Renewable heat sources such as [[Ground source heat pump|shallow geothermal]] and passive solar energy reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted. In addition to designing buildings which are more energy-efficient to heat, it is possible to design buildings that are more energy-efficient to cool by using lighter-coloured, more reflective materials in the development of urban areas (e.g. by painting roofs white) and planting trees.<ref>{{cite web

The [[Paris Agreement]] has become the main current international agreement on combating climate change. Each country must determine, plan, and regularly report on the contribution that it undertakes to mitigate global warming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/resource/bigpicture/|title=UNFCCC eHandbook: Summary of the Paris Agreement|website=unfccc.int|language=en|access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref> Climate change mitigation measures can be written down in national environmental policy documents like the [[Intended nationally determined contributions|nationally determined contributions (NDC)]].

The Paris agreement succeeds the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]] which expired in 2020. [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|Countries that ratified the Kyoto protocol]] committed to reduce their emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in [[emissions trading]] if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases.

=== Additional commitments ===
In addition to the main agreements, there are many additional pledges made by international coalitions, countries, cities, regions and businesses. According to a report published in September 2019 before the [[2019 UN Climate Action Summit]], full implementation of all pledges, including those in the Paris Agreement, will be sufficient to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees but not to 1.5 degrees.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|date=17 September 2019|title=Global climate action from cities, regions and businesses – 2019|url=https://newclimate.org/2019/09/18/global-climate-action-from-cities-regions-and-businesses-2019/|access-date=15 December 2019|website=New Climate Institute}}</ref> After the report was published, additional pledges were made in the September climate summit<ref name="climatechangenews.com">{{cite news|last1=Farland|first1=Chloe|date=2 October 2019|title=This is what the world promised at the UN climate action summit|agency=Climate Home News|url=https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/10/02/world-promised-un-climate-action-summit/|access-date=15 December 2019}}</ref> and in December of that year.<ref name="unfccc.int">{{cite web|title=Global Climate Action Presents a Blueprint for a 1.5-Degree World|url=https://unfccc.int/news/global-climate-action-presents-a-blueprint-for-a-15-degree-world|access-date=15 December 2019|website=UNFCCC}}</ref>

In December 2020 another climate action summit was held and important commitments were made. The organizers stated that, including the commitments expected in the beginning of the following year, countries representing 70% of the global economy will be committed to reach zero emissions by 2050.<ref>{{cite web |title=Climate Ambition Summit 2020 |url=https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/climate-ambition-summit-release.pdf |publisher=United Nations |access-date=29 December 2020}}</ref>

In September 2021 the US and EU launched the [[Global Methane Pledge]] to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. UK, Argentina, Indonesia, Italy and Mexico joined the initiative, "while Ghana and Iraq signaled interest in joining, according to a White House summary of the meeting, which noted those countries represent six of the top 15 methane emitters globally".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mason |first1=Jeff |last2=Alper |first2=Alexandra |title=Biden asks world leaders to cut methane in climate fight |url=https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/biden-convenes-world-leaders-discuss-climate-change-ahead-glasgow-summit-2021-09-17/ |access-date=8 October 2021 |work=Reuters |date=18 September 2021}}</ref> Israel also joined the initiative<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bassist |first1=Rina |title=At OECD, Israel joins global battle against climate change |url=https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/10/oecd-israel-joins-global-battle-against-climate-change |agency=Al - Monitor |date=6 October 2021}}</ref>

===Carbon pricing===
[[File:ETS-allowance-prices.svg|thumb|top|400px|Carbon emission trade - allowance prices from 2008]]
{{Main|Carbon price}}
{{Further|#Research}}
Additional costs on GHG emissions can lower competitiveness of fossil fuels and accelerate investments into low-carbon sources of energy. A growing number of countries raise a fixed [[carbon tax]] or participate in dynamic [[carbon emission trading]] (ETS) systems. In 2021, more than 21% of global GHG emissions were covered by a carbon price, a major increase due to the introduction of the [[Chinese national carbon trading scheme]].<ref>{{harvnb|World Bank|2021|p=23}}</ref>

Trading schemes offer the possibility to limit emission allowances to certain reduction targets. However, an oversupply of allowances keeps most ETS at low price levels around $10 with a low impact. This includes the Chinese ETS which started with $7/t{{CO2}} in 2021.<ref>{{Cite news|title=China's carbon market scheme too limited, say analysts|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3bcc2380-8544-4146-ba71-83944caff48d|url-status=live|access-date=2021-07-16|newspaper=Financial Times|date=16 July 2021|last1=Shepherd|first1=Christian}}</ref> One exception is the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] where prices began to rise in 2018, exceeding €63/t{{CO2}} ({{To USD|63|EUR|round=yes}} $) in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Carbon Price Viewer|url=https://ember-climate.org/data/carbon-price-viewer|publisher=EMBER|access-date=2021-10-10}}</ref> This results in additional costs of about €0.04/KWh for coal and €0.02/KWh for gas combustion for electricity, depending on the [[emission intensity]].

Latest models of the [[social cost of carbon]] calculate a damage of more than $3000 per ton {{CO2}} as a result of economy feedbacks and falling global [[GDP]] growth rates, while policy recommendations for a carbon price range from about $50 to $200.<ref>{{harvnb|Kikstra|2021|p=22}}</ref>

Most [[energy tax]]es are still levied on energy products and motor vehicles, rather than on {{CO2}} emissions directly.<ref name="ar4 emissions tax">{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG3 Ch13|2007|pp=755–756}}</ref> Non-transport sectors as the agricultural sector, which produces large amounts of methane, are typically left untaxed by current policies.

The revenue of carbon pricing can used to support policies that promote carbon neutrality. Another approach the concept of a [[carbon fee and dividend]] which includes the redistribution on a per-capita basis. As a result, households with a low consumption can even benefit from carbon pricing.

===Enaction of a state of emergency===
{{Main|Climate emergency declaration}}
Enacting a state of emergency may be composed of two elements: declaring a state of emergency that has formulated real-world i.e. legal effects and the associated enabling or ensuring of rapid complementary large-scale changes in human activity for the articulated purposes. To date, many governments have acknowledged, sometimes in the form of tentative text-form "declarations", that humanity is essentially in a state of climate emergency.

In November 2021, [[Greta Thunberg]] and other climate activists asked the United Nation to declare a level 3 systemwide climate emergency.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bryant |first1=Miranda |title=Youth activists petition UN to declare 'systemwide climate emergency' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/10/youth-activists-petition-un-to-declare-systemwide-climate-emergency |access-date=12 November 2021 |agency=The Guardian |date=10 November 2021}}</ref>

====Costs====
One way of estimating the cost of reducing emissions is by considering the likely costs of potential technological and output changes. Policy makers can compare the [[marginal abatement costs]] of different methods to assess the cost and amount of possible abatement over time. The marginal abatement costs of the various measures will differ by country, by sector, and over time.<ref name="stern"/> Mitigation costs will vary according to how and when emissions are cut: early, well-planned action will minimise the costs.<ref name="stern"/>

====Benefits====
By limiting climate change, some of the costs of the [[effects of climate change]] can be avoided.

According to the [[Stern Review]], inaction can be as high as the equivalent of losing at least 5% of global gross domestic product (GDP) each year, now and forever (up to 20% of the GDP or more when including a wider range of risks and impacts), whereas mitigating climate change will only cost about [[Stern Review#Stern's later comments|2% of the GDP]].

====Sharing====
One of the aspects of mitigation is how to share the costs and benefits of mitigation policies. Rich people tend to emit more GHG than poor people.<ref name=banuri>{{cite book

}}  PDF version: IPCC website.</ref>  Activities of the poor that involve emissions of GHGs are often associated with basic needs, such as [[cooking]]. For richer people, emissions tend to be associated with things such as eating [[beef]], cars, [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent flying]], and [[Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|home heating]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/behaviour-change-public-engagement-and-net-zero-imperial-college-london/|title=Behaviour change, public engagement and Net Zero (Imperial College London)|website=Committee on Climate Change|language=en-US|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref> The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human [[welfare economics|welfare]] according to wealth.

====Distributing emissions abatement costs====
There have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions (Banuri et al., 1996, pp.&nbsp;103–105):<ref name=banuri/>

* '''[[Egalitarianism]]''': this system interprets the problem as one where each person has equal rights to a global resource, i.e., polluting the atmosphere.
* '''Basic needs''': this system would have emissions allocated according to basic needs, as defined according to a minimum level of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.
* '''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the "polluter-pays principle", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:
** ''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-521-56854-8

|url-access=registration
}} Web version: IPCC website.</ref>
** ''Comparable burdens and ability to pay'': with this approach, countries would reduce emissions based on comparable burdens and their ability to take on the costs of reduction. Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].
** ''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.

====Specific proposals====
* '''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri et al., 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.
* '''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri et al., 1996, pp.&nbsp;106–107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.
* '''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri et al., 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.

===Barriers to implementation===
{{See also|Climate justice#Debate on complications}}
It has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are uncertainty, institutional void, short time horizon of policies and politicians and missing motives and willingness to start adapting. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. The short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made.<ref name="IHDP">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

====Carbon budgets by country====
An international policy to allocate [[carbon budget]]s to individual countries has not been implemented.

Already in 2018, its GHG emissions were 23% lower that in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |title=Progress made in cutting emissions |url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/progress_en |website=European Commission |date=23 November 2016 |access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref>

{{Further|Climate change in New Zealand}}

New Zealand made significant pledges on climate change mitigation in 2019: reduce emissions to zero by 2050, plant 1 billion trees by 2028, and encouraging farmers to reduce emissions by 2025 or face higher taxes Already in 2019 New Zealand banned new offshore oil and gas drilling and decided the climate change issues will be examined before every important decision.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ainge Roy |first1=Eleanor |title=Climate change to steer all New Zealand government decisions from now on |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/04/climate-change-to-steer-all-new-zealand-government-decisions-from-now-on |access-date=4 December 2019 |agency=The Guardian |publisher=The Dunedin |date=4 December 2019}}</ref>

In early December 2020, [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Jacinda Ardern]] declared a climate change emergency and pledged that the New Zealand Government would be carbon neutral by 2025. Key goals and initiatives include requiring the public sector to buy only electric or hybrid vehicles, government buildings will have to meet new "green" building standards, and all 200 coal-fired boilers in public service buildings will be phased out.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Phil |title=New Zealand declares a climate change emergency |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/02/new-zealand-declares-a-climate-change-emergency |access-date=2 December 2020 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201202030445/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/02/new-zealand-declares-a-climate-change-emergency |archive-date=2 December 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Cooke |first1=Henry |title=Government will have to buy electric cars and build green buildings as it declares climate change emergency |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300172852/government-will-have-to-buy-electric-cars-and-build-green-buildings-as-it-declares-climate-change-emergency |access-date=2 December 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=2 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201202053524/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300172852/government-will-have-to-buy-electric-cars-and-build-green-buildings-as-it-declares-climate-change-emergency |archive-date=2 December 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Nigeria ====
{{Further|Climate change in Nigeria}}

To mitigate the adverse effect of climate change, not only did Nigeria sign the Paris agreement to reduce emission, in its national climate pledge, the Nigerian government has promised to "work towards" ending gas flaring by 2030. In order to achieve this goal, the government established a Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme to encourage investment in practices that reduce gas flaring. Also, the federal government has approved a new National Forest Policy which is aimed at "protecting ecosystems" while enhancing social development. Effort is also been made to stimulate the adoption of climate-smart agriculture and the planting of trees.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Carbon Brief Profile: Nigeria|date=21 August 2020|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-profile-nigeria}}</ref>

=== Low and middle income countries ===
In order to reconcile [[economic development]] with mitigating carbon emissions, [[developing countries]] need particular support, both financial and technical. One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050409110349/http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ |date=9 April 2005 }} from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.

An important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>

# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];
# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;
# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and
# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.

The main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>

However, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions.

In an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] "which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>

In 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and "sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |access-date=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |access-date=25 August 2019}}</ref>

=== Carbon neutral and carbon negative countries ===
As of the year 2021, 3 countries became [[carbon negative]], meaning they remove from the atmosphere more [[Greenhouse gas emissions]] then they emit. The countries are: [[Bhutan]], [[Suriname]], [[Panama]]. The countries formed a small coalition at [[2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] and asked for help so that other countries will join it.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Goering |first1=Laurie |title=Forget net-zero: meet the small-nation, carbon-negative club |url=https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/forget-net-zero-meet-small-nation-carbon-negative-club-2021-11-03/ |access-date=2 January 2022 |work=Reuters |date=3 November 2021}}</ref>

=== Requirements ===
Proving that [[Extreme event attribution|some weather events are due specifically to global warming]] is now possible, and methodologies have been developed to show the increased risk of other events caused by global warming.<ref>Stott, et al. (2004), "Human contribution to the European heatwave of 2003", Nature, Vol. 432, 2 December 2004</ref>

For a legal action for [[negligence]] (or similar) to succeed, "Plaintiffs ... must show that, more probably than not, their individual injuries were caused by the risk factor in question, as opposed to any other cause. This has sometimes been translated to a requirement of a relative risk of at least two."<ref>Grossman, Columbia J. of Env.

Funding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the [[Global Environment Facility|Global Environmental Facility]] (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name="Evans">Evans.

In a 2021 paper for ''Sustainability Science'', [[William J. Ripple]], lead author of the [[World Scientists' Warning to Humanity|World Scientists' Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice]], Christopher Wolf and Eileen Crist demonstrate that "human population has been mostly ignored with regard to climate policy" and attribute this to the taboo nature of the issue given its association with population policies of the past, including [[Compulsory sterilization|forced sterilization]] campaigns and China's [[one-child policy]]. They take a different approach and argue that population policies can both advance [[social justice]] (such as by abolishing child marriage, expanding family planning services and reforms that improve education for women and girls) while at the same time mitigating the human impact on the climate and the earth system. They say that while [[overconsumption]] by the world's wealthy is responsible for 90% of GHG emissions, which can be redressed through [[Ecotax|eco-taxes]], [[Carbon price|carbon pricing]] and other policies, the global human population of 7.7 billion contributes to climate change in myriad ways, including the consumption of natural resources and GHG emissions from transportation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wolf |first1=C. |last2=Ripple |first2=W.J. |last3=Crist |first3=E. |date=2021 |title=Human population, social justice, and climate policy |journal=Sustainability Science |volume=16 |issue= 5|pages=1753–1756 |doi=10.1007/s11625-021-00951-w|s2cid=233404010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2021-04-socially-population-policies-mitigate-climate.html |title=Socially just population policies can mitigate climate change and advance global equity |author=<!--Staff writer(s)/no by-line.--> |date=April 28, 2021 |website=[[Phys.org]] |publisher= |access-date=October 4, 2021}}</ref>

These appear to differ significantly from the popular advice for "greening" one's lifestyle, which seem to fall mostly into the "low-impact" category: Replacing a typical car with a hybrid (0.52 tonnes); Washing clothes in cold water (0.25 tonnes); Recycling (0.21 tonnes); Upgrading light bulbs (0.10 tonnes); etc. The researchers found that public discourse on reducing one's carbon footprint overwhelmingly focuses on low-impact behaviors, and that mention of the high-impact behaviors is almost non-existent in the mainstream media, government publications, school textbooks, etc.<ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/><ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05>{{cite journal |last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul P |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089–E6096|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich.
