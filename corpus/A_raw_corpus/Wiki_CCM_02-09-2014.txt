One of the issues often discussed in relation to climate change mitigation is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) has the ultimate objective of [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|preventing "dangerous" anthropogenic (i.e., human) interference of the climate system]]. As is stated in Article 2 of the Convention, this requires that greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where [[climate change and ecosystems|ecosystems]] can adapt naturally to climate change, [[climate change and agriculture|food production]] is not threatened, and [[economics of global warming|economic development]] can proceed in a sustainable fashion.<ref>{{cite book

Stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of the other greenhouse gases humans emit also depends on how fast their emissions are added to the atmosphere, and how fast the GHGs are removed.

===Energy consumption by power source===

To create lasting climate change mitigation, the replacement of high carbon [[emission intensity]] power sources, such as conventional [[fossil fuel]]s - [[oil]], [[coal]] and [[natural gas]] - with [[low-carbon power]] sources is required. Fossil fuels supply humanity with the vast majority of our energy demands, and at a growing rate. In 2012 the IEA noted that coal accounted for half the increased energy use of the prior decade, growing faster than all renewable energy sources.<ref>[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/English.pdf World energy outlook 2012 (IEA)]</ref> Both [[hydroelectricity]] and [[nuclear power]] together provide the majority of the generated [[low-carbon power]] fraction of global total power consumption.

Natural gas emits far fewer greenhouse gases (i.e. CO2 and Methane - CH4) than coal when burned at power plants, but evidence has been emerging that this benefit could be completely negated by methane leakage at gas drilling fields and other earlier points in the production lifecycle.

A study performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of methane emissions from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. More recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged the findings of this study, with researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas fields.

A 2011 study <ref name="usclimatenetwork.org">http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/resource-database/report-coal-to-gas-the-influence-of-methane-leakage</ref> by noted climate research scientist, Tom Wigley,<ref>[[Tom Wigley]]</ref> found that while carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion may be reduced by using natural gas rather than coal to produce energy, it also found that additional methane (CH4) from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in CO2 forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. The study looked at methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced CO2 emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0%, and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10%. The overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century, however, are small. Petron et al. (2013) <ref name="epa.gov">http://www.epa.gov/ttnchie1/conference/ei20/session6/gpetron.pdf</ref> and Alvarez et al. (2012)<ref>http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/04/02/1202407109.abstract</ref> note that estimated that leakage from gas infrastructure is likely to be underestimated. These studies indicate that the exploitation of natural gas as a "cleaner" fuel is questionable.

===Energy efficiency and conservation===
{{Main|Efficient energy use|Energy conservation}}
[[File:Compact-Fluorescent-Bulb.jpg|thumb|250px|upright=1.00|A spiral-type integrated [[compact fluorescent lamp]], use has grown among North American consumers since its introduction in the mid-1990s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philips Tornado Asian Compact Fluorescent | publisher=Philips | accessdate=2007-12-24 | url=http://www.lamptech.co.uk/Spec%20Sheets/Philips%20CFL%20Tornado.htm}}</ref>]]

Efficient energy use, sometimes simply called "energy efficiency", is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[fluorescent lights]] or natural [[Skylight (window)|skylights]] reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional [[incandescent light bulbs]]. [[Compact fluorescent lights]] use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights.<ref>[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, p. 86.</ref>

Energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[World energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]]. For example, the state of [[California]] began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s, including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements. During the following years, California's energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national U.S. consumption doubled. As part of its strategy, California implemented a "loading order" for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first, renewable electricity supplies second, and new fossil-fired power plants last.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>

[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses using less energy to achieve a lesser energy service, for example through behavioural change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency.  Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter, driving less, or working in a less brightly lit room.  As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms.  This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.</ref>

Reducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[Energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[Sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=2929&language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>

===Sinks and negative emissions===
{{Main|Carbon sink|Negative carbon dioxide emission}}

A [[carbon sink]] is a natural or artificial reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period, such as a growing [[forest]]. A [[negative carbon dioxide emission]] on the other hand is a permanent removal of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, such as directly capturing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and storing it in [[Carbon capture and storage#Geological storage|geologic formations]] underground.

The Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE-CRC) notes that one third of humankind’s annual emissions of CO2 are absorbed by the oceans. The oceans act as a carbon sink, that is, a reservoir that accumulates and stores carbon via its physicochemical and biological processes.<ref>http://www.acecrc.org.au/Research/Southern%20Ocean%20Carbon%20Sink</ref> Unfortunately, this "vital service comes with the cost of [[ocean acidification]]". The ecological effects of ocean acidification are still largely unknown. Research so far has focussed on how acidification lowers pH and the level of carbonate ions available for calcifying organisms to form their shells. These organisms include plankton species that contribute to the foundation of the Southern Ocean food web. However acidification may impact on a broad range of other physiological and ecological processes, such as fish respiration, larval development and changes in the solubility of both nutrients and toxins.<ref>http://www.acecrc.org.au/Research/Ocean%20Acidification</ref> According to the CSIRO <ref>[[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]]</ref> the Southern Ocean is absorbing increasing amounts of carbon dioxide, with potentially significant impacts on marine life.<ref>http://www.csiro.au/Outcomes/Climate/Understanding/ClimateChangeCO2inOceans.aspx</ref>

====Reforestation and avoided deforestation====
[[File:Cow female black white.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Managed grazing methods are argued to be able to restore grasslands, thereby significantly decreasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels.<ref name=ASavory/>]]
{{Main|Deforestation|Reforestation|Biosequestration}}
Almost 20% (8 GtCO<sub>2</sub>/year) of total greenhouse-gas emissions were from deforestation in 2007. The Stern Review found that, based on the [[opportunity costs]] of the landuse that would no longer be available for agriculture if deforestation were avoided, emission savings from avoided deforestation could potentially reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for under $5/tCO<sub>2</sub>, possiblly as little as $1/tCO<sub>2</sub>. [[Afforestation]] and [[reforestation]] could save at least another 1GtCO<sub>2</sub>/year, at an estimated cost of $5/tCO<sub>2</sub> to $15/tCO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="stern"/> The Review determined these figures by assessing 8 countries responsible for 70% of global deforestation emissions. Pristine [[temperate forest]] has been shown to store three times more carbon than IPCC estimates took into account, and 60% more carbon than [[plantation forest]].<ref>Young, E. (2008). ''IPCC Wrong On Logging Threat to Climate.'' New Scientist, August 5, 2008. Retrieved on August 18, 2008, from http://environment.newscientist.com/article/dn14466-ipcc-wrong-on-logging-threat-toclimate.html</ref> Preventing these forests from being logged would have significant effects. Further significant savings from other non-energy-related-emissions could be gained through cuts to [[agricultural emissions]], [[fugitive emissions]], [[waste emissions]], and emissions from various [[industrial processes]].<ref name="stern"/> Using evidence from Mozambique, a typical low income country where agriculture is the dominant provider of income for most citizens, researchers from the [[Overseas Development Institute]] found a positive correlation between increased production intensification and reduced land conversion, and crop returns, economic growth and food security.<ref>Wiggins, S., Chant, L., McDonald, S. and Wright, J., February 2012.

Restoring grasslands store CO<sub>2</sub> from the air into plant material. Grazing livestock, usually not left to wander, would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth while grass left alone would eventually grow to cover its own growing buds, preventing them from photosynthesizing and killing the plant.<ref name=Tlovell>{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2011/01/lovell-carbon-ward-climate|title=How fences could save the planet|publisher=newstatesman.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=January 13, 2011}}</ref>  A method proposed to restore grasslands uses fences with many small paddocks and moving herds from one paddock to another after a day a two in order to mimick natural grazers and allowing the grass to grow optimally.<ref name=Tlovell/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0221-soil_carbon_lovell_interview.html|title=Restoring soil carbon can reverse global warming, desertification and biodiversity|publisher=mongabay.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=February 21, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1953692,00.html|title=How eating grass-fed beef could help fight climate change|publisher=time.com|accessdate=May 11, 2013|date=January 25, 2010}}</ref> It is estimated that increasing the carbon content of the soils in the world’s 3.5 billion hectares of agricultural grassland by 1% would offset nearly 12 years of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<ref name=Tlovell/> [[Allan Savory]], as part of [[holistic management]], claims that while large herds are often blamed for desertification, prehistoric lands used to support large or larger herds and areas where herds were removed in the United States are still desertifying.<ref name=ASavory>{{cite news|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/06/how-cows-could-repair-the-world-allan-savory-at-ted/|title=How cows could repair the world|publisher=nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=March 6, 2013}}</ref>

====Carbon capture and storage====
[[File:Carbon sequestration-2009-10-07.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic showing both terrestrial and geological sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions from a coal-fired plant.]]
{{Main|Carbon capture and storage}}

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a method to mitigate climate change by capturing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) from large point sources such as power plants and subsequently storing it away safely instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says CCS could contribute between 10% and 55% of the cumulative worldwide carbon-mitigation effort over the next 90 years. The International Energy Agency says CCS is "the most important single new technology for CO<sub>2</sub> savings" in power generation and industry.<ref name=futureenergysummit>{{cite news|last=Robinson |first=Simon |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1954176_1954175,00.html |title=How to Reduce Carbon Emissions: Capture and Store it? |publisher=[[Time.com]] |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> Though it requires up to 40% more energy to run a CCS coal power plant than a regular coal plant, CCS could potentially capture about 90% of all the carbon emitted by the plant.<ref name=futureenergysummit/> [[Norway]], which first began storing CO<sub>2</sub>, has cut its emissions by almost a million tons a year, or about 3% of the country's 1990 levels.<ref name=futureenergysummit/> As of late 2011, the total CO2 storage capacity of all 14 projects in operation or under construction is over 33 million tonnes a year.

===Geoengineering===
{{Main|geoengineering}}

Geoengineering is seen by some{{Who|date=May 2010}} as an alternative to mitigation and adaptation, but by others{{Who|date=May 2010}} as an entirely separate response to climate change. In a [[scientific literature|literature]] assessment, Barker ''et al.'' (2007) described geoengineering as a type of mitigation policy.<ref>{{cite book

Chapter 28 of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] report ''Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base'' (1992) defined geoengineering as "options that would involve large-scale engineering of our environment in order to combat or counteract the effects of changes in atmospheric chemistry."<ref name="nas_policy_implications">[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1605&page=433 Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base] (1992), [[Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy]] (COSEPUP)</ref>  They evaluated a range of options to try to give preliminary answers to two questions: can these options work and could they be carried out with a reasonable cost. They also sought to encourage discussion of a third question&nbsp;— what adverse side effects might there be. The following types of option were examined: reforestation, increasing ocean absorption of carbon dioxide (carbon sequestration) and screening out some sunlight. NAS also argued "Engineered countermeasures need to be evaluated but should not be implemented without broad understanding of the direct effects and the potential side effects, the ethical issues, and the risks.".<ref name="nas_policy_implications"/> In July 2011 a report by the [[United States Government Accountability Office]] on geoengineering found that "[c]limate engineering technologies do not now offer a viable response to global climate change."<ref>GAO (2011).

====Carbon dioxide removal====
{{Main|Carbon dioxide removal|Greenhouse gas remediation|Carbon sequestration}}
{{See also|Carbon air capture}}

[[Carbon dioxide removal]] has been proposed as a method of reducing the amount of radiative forcing.  A variety of means of artificially capturing and storing carbon, as well as of enhancing natural sequestration processes, are being explored. The main natural process is [[photosynthesis]] by plants and single-celled organisms (see [[biosequestration]]). Artificial processes vary, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of some of these processes.<ref name=RoyalSociety>The Royal Society, (2009) [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=35151 "Geoengineering the climate: science, governance and uncertainty"]. Retrieved 2009-09-12.</ref>

It is notable that the availability of cheap energy and appropriate sites for [[carbon capture and storage|geological storage]] of carbon may make [[carbon dioxide air capture]] viable commercially.  It is, however, generally expected that carbon dioxide air capture may be uneconomic when compared to [[carbon capture and storage]] from major sources&nbsp;— in particular, fossil fuel powered power stations, refineries, etc. In such cases, costs of energy produced will grow significantly.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} However, captured CO<sub>2</sub> can be used to force more [[crude oil]] out of [[oil field]]s, as [[Statoil]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] have made plans to do.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090212213143/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2006/03/08/afx2578203.html Statoil, Shell in plan to raise oil output by injecting {{CO2}} – report], [[AFX News]] via [[Forbes]], March 8, 2006, checked 2009-01-15</ref>  CO<sub>2</sub> can also be used in commercial [[greenhouse]]s, giving an opportunity to kick-start the technology.

====Solar radiation management====

The main purpose of solar radiation management seek to reflect sunlight and thus reduce global warming. The ability of stratospheric [[sulfate aerosols]] to create a [[global dimming]] effect has made them a possible candidate for use in [[geoengineering]] projects.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/84j11614488142u8/ |journal=Phil.

===Non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases===

CO<sub>2</sub> is not the only GHG relevant to mitigation,<ref>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6065/183</ref> and governments have acted to regulate the emissions of other GHGs emitted by human activities ([[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] GHGs). The emissions caps agreed to by most developed countries under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] regulate the emissions of almost all the anthropogenic GHGs.<ref>
{{cite journal
| title=The Economics of the Kyoto Protocol

These gases are CO<sub>2</sub>, [[methane]] (chemical formula: CH<sub>4</sub>), [[nitrous oxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O), the [[halocarbon|hydrofluorocarbons]] (abbreviated HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF<sub>6</sub>).

Stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of the different anthropogenic GHGs requires an understanding of their different physical properties. Stabilization depends both on how quickly GHGs are added to the atmosphere and how fast they are removed. The rate of removal is measured by the atmospheric lifetime of the GHG in question (see the [[greenhouse gas#Global warming potential|main GHG article]] for a list). Here, the lifetime is defined as the time required for a given perturbation of the GHG in the atmosphere to be reduced to 37% of its initial amount.<ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/>
Methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 12 years, while N<sub>2</sub>O's lifetime is about 110 years. For methane, a reduction of about 30% below current emission levels would lead to a stabilization in its atmospheric concentration, while for N<sub>2</sub>O, an emissions reduction of more than 50% would be required.<ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/>

[[Methane]] is a significantly more powerful greenhouse gas than [[carbon dioxide]].  Burning one molecule of methane generates one molecule of carbon dioxide, indicating there may be no net benefit in using gas as a fuel source.<ref name="usclimatenetwork.org"/><ref name="epa.gov"/> Reducing the amount of waste methane produced in the first place and moving away from use of gas as a fuel source will have a greater beneficial impact, as might other approaches to productive use of otherwise-wasted methane. In terms of prevention, vaccines are in the works in Australia to reduce significant global warming contributions from [[methane]] released by livestock via [[flatulence]] and [[eructation]].<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6431 Burp vaccine cuts greenhouse gas emissions] ''Rachel Nowak'' for NewScientist September 2004</ref>

Another physical property of the anthropogenic GHGs relevant to mitigation is the different abilities of the gases to trap heat (in the form of [[infrared radiation]]). Some gases are more effective at trapping heat than others, e.g., SF<sub>6</sub> is 22,200 times more effective a GHG than CO<sub>2</sub> on a per-kilogram basis.<ref>

===Urban planning===
{{Main|Urban planning}}

Effective [[urban planning]] to reduce [[Urban sprawl|sprawl]] would decrease Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT), lowering emissions from transportation. Increased use of [[public transport]] can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions per passenger kilometer. Between 1982 and 1997, the amount of land consumed for [[urban development]] in the United States increased by 47 percent while the nation's population grew by only 17 percent.<ref>{{cite web

Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.

At the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greennhouse gas emissions.

Approaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[Transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through "medium-density", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book "Sustainability and Cities" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->

Smarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.

====Building design====
{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}

Emissions from [[House|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{Cite news

New buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources. Existing buildings can be made more efficient through the use of insulation, high-efficiency appliances (particularly [[hot water heater]]s and [[furnaces]]), [[insulated glazing|double- or triple-glazed gas-filled windows]], external window shades, and building orientation and siting. Renewable heat sources such as [[geothermal heat pump|shallow geothermal]] and [[passive solar]] energy reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted. In addition to designing buildings which are more energy-efficient to heat, it is possible to design buildings that are more energy-efficient to cool by using lighter-coloured, more reflective materials in the development of urban areas (e.g. by painting roofs white) and planting trees.<ref>{{cite web

===Societal controls===
Another method being examined is to make carbon a new currency by introducing tradeable "Personal Carbon Credits". The idea being it will encourage and motivate individuals to reduce their 'carbon footprint' by the way they live. Each citizen will receive a free annual quota of carbon that they can use to travel, buy food, and go about their business. It has been suggested that by using this concept it could actually solve two problems; pollution and poverty, old age pensioners will actually be better off because they fly less often, so they can cash in their quota at the end of the year to pay heating bills, etc.{{Citation needed|reason=previous source deadlink|date=April 2009}}

====Population====
[[File:Countries by population density.svg|thumb|400px|[[Population density]] by country]]
Various organizations promote [[population control]] as a means for mitigating global warming.<ref>[http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2009/en/ch6.shtml Facing a changing world: women, population and climate], United Nations Population Fund</ref><ref>[http://www.sierraclub.org/population/reports/globalwarming.asp Population and Global Warming Factsheet] from Sierra Club</ref><ref>[http://www.nwf.org/popandenvironment/globalwarming.cfm Population and Global Warming] National Wild Life Federation</ref><ref>[http://www.populationconnection.org/site/DocServer/Global_Warming.pdf?docID=286 Population and the Environment Fact Sheet] Population Connection</ref><ref>[http://www.populationconnection.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_us Population Connection]  Statement of Policy</ref>  Proposed measures include improving access to [[family planning]] and [[reproductive health]] care and information, reducing [[natalistic politics]], public education about the consequences of continued population growth, and improving access of women to education and economic opportunities.

Population control efforts are impeded by there being somewhat of a taboo in some countries against considering any such efforts.<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/315/7120/1441 To the point of farce: a martian view of the hardinian taboo—the silence that surrounds population control] Maurice King, Charles Elliott BMJ</ref>  Also, various religions [[Religious views on birth control|discourage or prohibit]] some or all forms of [[birth control]].

Population size has a different per capita effect on global warming in different countries, since the per capita production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases varies greatly by country.<ref>[http://www.sierraclub.org/population/factsheets/pop_and_globalwarming.asp Who is Heating Up the Planet?

==Costs and benefits==
{{Main|Economics of climate change mitigation}}

===Costs===

The [[Stern Review]] proposes stabilising the concentration of greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere at a maximum of 550ppm CO<sub>2</sub>e by 2050. The Review estimates that this would mean cutting total greenhouse-gas emissions to three quarters of 2007 levels. The Review further estimates that the cost of these cuts would be in the range −1.0 to +3.5% of World [[GDP]], (i.e. [[Gross world product|GWP]]), with an average estimate of approximately 1%.<ref name="stern"/> Stern has since revised his estimate to 2% of GWP.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jun/26/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange |title=Cost of tackling global climate change has doubled, warns Stern |first= Juliette |last=Jowit |first2= Patrick |last2=Wintour |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 June 2008 |location=London}}</ref> For comparison, the Gross World Product (GWP) at [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] was estimated at $74.5 trillion in 2010,<ref>{{cite web
  | title = CIA World Factbook | publisher = US [[CIA]] | date = 18 Oct 2011
  | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html
  | accessdate = 21 Oct 2011}}</ref> thus 2% is approximately $1.5 trillion. The Review emphasises that these costs are contingent on steady reductions in the cost of low-carbon technologies. Mitigation costs will also vary according to how and when emissions are cut: early, well-planned action will minimise the costs.<ref name="stern">Stern, N. (2007). ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change: Part III: The Economics of Stabilisation.'' HM Treasury, London: http://hm-treasury.gov.uk/sternreview_index.htm</ref>

One way of estimating the cost of reducing emissions is by considering the likely costs of potential technological and output changes. Policy makers can compare the [[marginal abatement costs]] of different methods to assess the cost and amount of possible abatement over time. The marginal abatement costs of the various measures will differ by country, by sector, and over time.<ref name="stern"/>

This was judged to be especially the case when combined with enhanced adaptation. By 2100, however, it was still judged likely that there would be significant [[effects of global warming]]. This was judged to be the case even with aggressive mitigation and significantly enhanced [[adaptive capacity]].

|doi=10.2277/0521568544}}</ref> Wealth, as measured by per capita income (i.e., income per head of population), varies widely between different countries. Activities of the poor that involve emissions of GHGs are often associated with basic needs, such as [[heating]] to stay tolerably warm. In richer countries, emissions tend to be associated with things like [[car]]s, [[central heating]], etc. The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human [[welfare economics|welfare]] according wealth.

====Distributing emissions abatement costs====

There have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;103–105):<ref name=banuri/>
*'''[[Egalitarianism]]''': this system interprets the problem as one where each person has equal rights to a global resource, i.e., polluting the atmosphere.
*'''Basic needs and Rawlsian criteria''': this system would have emissions allocated according to basic needs, as defined according to a minimum level of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. This can be related to [[John Rawls|Rawlsian]] [[philosophy]]. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.
*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the "polluter-pays principle", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:
**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book
|year=1996
|author=Goldemberg, J. ''et al''.
|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment. In: Climate Change 1995: Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change. Contribution of Working Group III to the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (J.P. Bruce ''et al''. Eds.)

|isbn=978-0-521-56854-8
|doi=10.2277/0521568544}}</ref>
**''Comparable burdens and ability to pay'': with this approach, countries would reduce emissions based on comparable burdens and their ability to take on the costs of reduction. Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].
**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit from reducing their emissions.

====Specific proposals====

*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.
*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106–107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.
*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.

|accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref> Use of these technologies aids mitigation and could result in substantial reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Policies include targets for emissions reductions, increased use of renewable energy, and increased energy efficiency.  It is often argued that the results of climate change are more damaging in poor nations, where infrastructures are weak and few social services exist.  The [[Commitment to Development Index]] is one attempt to analyze rich country policies taken to reduce their disproportionate use of the global commons.  Countries do well if their greenhouse gas emissions are falling, if their gas taxes are high, if they do not subsidize the fishing industry, if they have a low fossil fuel rate per capita, and if they control imports of illegally cut tropical timber.

===Kyoto Protocol===
{{Main|Kyoto Protocol}}

The main current international agreement on combating climate change is the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which came into force on 16 February 2005.  The Kyoto Protocol is an [[wiktionary:Amendment|amendment]] to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|Countries that have ratified this protocol]] have committed to reduce their emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in [[emissions trading]] if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases.

However, deciding what policies are best requires value judgements.<ref name="wg 2 ch19 dangerous climate change"/> For example, limiting global warming to 1&nbsp;°C relative to pre-industrial levels may help to reduce climate change damages more than a 2&nbsp;°C limit.<ref>
"Implication for Carbon Emissions Target," in: {{harvnb|Hansen|others|2013|p=15}}
</ref> However, a 1&nbsp;°C limit may be more costly to achieve than a 2&nbsp;°C limit.<ref>
"4. Discussion and conclusions," in: {{harvnb|Luderer|others|2013|p=6}}
</ref>

According to some analysts, the 2 °C "guardrail" is inadequate for the needed degree and timeliness of mitigation.<ref name="existing policies inadequate"/> On the other hand, some economic studies suggest more modest mitigation policies.<ref name="van vuuren mitigation policy"/> For example, the emissions reductions proposed by Nordhaus (2010)<ref name="nordhaus 2010 cba">
Figure 3, in: {{harvnb|Nordhaus|2010|p=4}}
</ref> might lead to global warming (in the year 2100) of around 3&nbsp;°C, relative to pre-industrial levels.

====Emissions tax====
{{See also|carbon tax|energy tax|fee and dividend}}

An emissions tax on greenhouse gas emissions requires individual emitters to pay a fee, charge or tax for every tonne of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere.<ref name="gupta emissions tax">{{cite book

Emission taxes can be both cost-effective and environmentally effective.<ref name="gupta emissions tax"/>  Difficulties with emission taxes include their potential unpopularity, and the fact that they cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions reduction.<ref name="gupta emissions tax"/>  Emissions or energy taxes also often fall disproportionately on lower income classes. In developing countries, institutions may be insufficiently developed for the collection of emissions fees from a wide variety of sources.<ref name="gupta emissions tax"/>

====Making the emitting of CO2 illegal====
Another option is to replace the emission [[Negative feedback|reduction-positive]] approach{{clarify|date=February 2013}} proposed with the Kyoto protocol and its successor with an emitted GHG-negative approach.{{clarify|date=February 2013}}

Scientist [[Ken Caldeira]] has proposed making greenhouse gas-emitting devices illegal.<ref>[http://e360.yale.edu/feature/geoengineering_the_planet_the_possibilities_and_the_pitfalls/2201/]</ref>

====Subsidies====
According to [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], a program of subsidization balanced against expected flood costs could pay for conversion to 100% renewable power by 2030.<ref name="wws-review">Jacobson, M.Z. (2009) [http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/PDF%20files/ReviewSolGW09.pdf "Review of solutions to global warming, air pollution, and energy security"] ''Energy and Environmental Science'' '''2''':148-73 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b809990c doi 10.1039/b809990c] (review.)</ref> Jacobson, and his colleague Mark Delucchi, suggest that the cost to generate and transmit power in 2020 will be less than 4 cents per kilowatt hour (in 2007 dollars) for wind, about 4 cents for wave and hydroelectric, from 4 to 7 cents for geothermal, and 8 cents per kwh for solar, fossil, and nuclear power.<ref name=wws>{{Cite journal|last1 = [[Mark Z.

====Carbon emissions trading====
{{Main|Carbon emissions trading}}

With the creation of a [[Market (economics)|market]] for [[carbon emissions trading|trading carbon dioxide emissions]] within the Kyoto Protocol, it is likely that London financial markets will be the centre for this potentially highly lucrative business; the [[NYSE|New York]] and [[Chicago]] stock markets may have a lower trade volume than expected as long as the US maintains its rejection of the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]].<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,,1509761,00.html How high-pressure politics threatens action on climate] The Observer June 2005</ref>

However, emissions trading may delay the phase-out of fossil fuels.<ref>''StoryOfStuff.com'' (2009) [http://storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/ "The Story of Cap and Trade"]</ref>

The [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS)<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission.htm Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS)] from ''ec.europa.eu''</ref> is the largest multi-national, greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world.  It commenced operation on 1 January 2005, and all 25 member states of the [[European Union]] participate in the scheme which has created a new market in carbon dioxide allowances estimated at 35&nbsp;billion Euros (US$43&nbsp;billion) per year.<ref>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/2570.jsp The $20,000,000,000,000 question] ''Robins, Nick'' for Opendemocracy</ref> The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] was the first (voluntary) emissions market, and is soon to be followed by Asia's first market ([[Asia Carbon Exchange]]). A total of 107 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent have been exchanged through projects in 2004, a 38% increase relative to 2003 (78 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e).<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/docs/CarbonMarketStudy2005.pdf State and Trends of the Carbon Market] International Emissions Trading Association 2005</ref>

Twenty three [[multinational corporation]]s have come together in the [[G8 Climate Change Roundtable]], a business group formed at the January 2005 [[World Economic Forum]]. The group includes [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Toyota]], [[British Airways]] and [[BP]]. On 9 June 2005 the Group published a statement<ref>[http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf Statement of G8 Climate Change Roundtable] Convened by the World Economic Forum June 2005</ref> stating that there was a need to act on climate change and claiming that market-based solutions can help. It called on governments to establish "clear, transparent, and consistent price signals" through "creation of a long-term policy framework" that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases.

The [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] is a proposed carbon trading scheme being created by nine North-eastern and Mid-Atlantic [[United States|American]] states; [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[Vermont]]. The scheme was due to be developed by April 2005 but has not yet been completed.

===Implementation===
Implementation puts into effect climate change mitigation strategies and targets. These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name="Evans">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>

====Funding====
Implementation requires funding sources but is often beset by disputes over who should provide funds and under what conditions.<ref name="Evans"/> A lack of funding can be a barrier to successful strategies as there are no formal arrangements to finance climate change development and implementation.<ref name="IHDP">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat. P, Klostermann.J.E.M (unpublished) Institutional governance barriers for the development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies, Working paper for the International Human Dimensions Programme (IHDP) conference “Earth System Governance: People, Places, and the Planet”, December 2–4, Amsterdam, the Netherlands</ref> Funding is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name="Evans"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which land degradation and persistent organic pollutant were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF’s implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H. T, Eberhard. A. A (2008) Evaluating the Global Environment Facility: A goodwill gesture or a serious attempt to deliver global benefits?, Global Environmental Change 18, 800–810</ref>

====Problems====
There are numerous issues which result in a current perceived lack of implementation.<ref name="Evans"/> It has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are, Uncertainty, Fragmentation, Institutional void, Short time horizon of policies and politicians and Missing motives and willingness to start adapting. The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues.  Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name="IHDP"/>

====Occurrence====
Despite a perceived lack of occurrence, evidence of implementation is emerging internationally. Some examples of this are the initiation of NAPA’s and of joint implementation. Many developing nations have made National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs) which are frameworks to prioritize adaption needs.<ref name="EMJ">Preston. B. L, Westaway. R. M, Yuen. E. Y (2004) Climate adaptation planning in practice: an evaluation of adaptation plans from three developed nations, European Management Journal, 22(3) 304-314</ref> The implementation of many of these is supported by GEF agencies.<ref>UNFCCC (2011) Report on the twentieth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group, Subsidiary Body for Implementation, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</ref> Many developed countries are implementing ‘first generation’ institutional adaption plans particularly at the state and local government scale.<ref name="EMJ"/> There has also been a push towards joint implementation between countries by the UNFCC as this has been suggested as a cost-effective way for objectives to be achieved.<ref>UNFCCC (2011) Annual report of the Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</ref>

===Territorial policies===
{{See also|List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions}}

====United States====
{{main|Climate change in the United States}}
Efforts to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions by the United States]] include [[Energy policy of the United States|energy policies]] which encourage efficiency through programs like [[Energy Star]], [[Commercial Building Integration]], and the [[Industrial Technologies Program]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/index.html |title=Industrial Technologies Program: BestPractices |publisher=Eere.energy.gov |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> On 12 November 1998, Vice President [[Al Gore]] symbolically signed the Kyoto Protocol, but he indicated participation by the developing nations was necessary prior its being submitted for ratification by the [[United States Senate]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/12/11/kyoto/ |date=1997-12-11 |title=Clinton Hails Global Warming Pact|work =All Politics|publisher =CNN|accessdate=2006-11-05}}</ref>

In 2007, Transportation Secretary [[Mary Peters (politician)|Mary Peters]], with White House approval, urged governors and dozens of members of the House of Representatives to block California’s first-in-the-nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks, according to e-mails obtained by Congress.<ref>[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/09/25/4099/ "How the White House Worked to Scuttle California’s Climate Law"], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], September 25, 2007</ref> The [[U.S. Climate Change Science Program]] is a group of about twenty federal agencies and US Cabinet Departments, all working together to address global warming.

The [[Bush administration (2000)|Bush administration]] pressured American scientists to suppress discussion of global warming, according to the testimony of the Union of Concerned Scientists to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives.<ref name=autogenerated2>Reuters, January 30, 2007, free archived version at http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0130-10.htm, last visited Jan. 30, '07</ref><ref>Written testimony of Dr. Grifo before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf</ref> "High-quality science" was "struggling to get out," as the Bush administration pressured scientists to tailor their writings on global warming to fit the Bush administration's skepticism, in some cases at the behest of an ex-oil industry lobbyist. "Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change,' 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications." Similarly, according to the testimony of senior officers of the [[Government Accountability Project]], the White House attempted to bury the report "National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change," produced by U.S. scientists pursuant to U.S. law.<ref>written testimony of Rick Piltz before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf last visited Jan. 30, 07</ref> Some U.S. scientists resigned their jobs rather than give in to White House pressure to underreport global warming.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

In the absence of substantial federal action, state governments have adopted emissions-control laws such as the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] in the Northeast and the [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]] in California.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/science/earth/in-california-a-grand-experiment-to-rein-in-climate-change.html | work=The New York Times | first=Felicity | last=Barringer | title=In California, a Grand Experiment to Rein in Climate Change | date=2012-10-13}}</ref>

====Developing countries====

In order to reconcile [[economic development]] with mitigating carbon emissions, [[developing countries]] need particular support, both financial and technical. One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.

An important point of contention, however, is how overseas development assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US $30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found 4 main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>
# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Controversy over funding of 0.7% of GNI|‘0.7%’ ODA target]];
# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;
# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and
# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.
The main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>

However, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions.  Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.

In an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha round|Doha trade round]] "which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services".<ref>[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>

==Non-governmental approaches==
While many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.

===Choices in personal actions and business operations===

Environmental groups encourage [[Individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]]. Common recommendations include lowering home heating and cooling usage, burning less gasoline, supporting renewable [[energy sources]], buying local products to reduce transportation, turning off unused devices, and various others.

A [[geophysicist]] at [[Utrecht University]] has urged similar institutions to hold the vanguard in voluntary mitigation, suggesting the use of communications technologies such as [[videoconferencing]] to reduce their dependence on long-haul flights.<ref>

==== Air travel and shipment ====

In 2008, climate scientist [[Kevin Anderson (scientist)|Kevin Anderson]] raised concern about the growing effect of rapidly increasing global air transport on the climate in a paper,<ref>{{cite journal

|quote= (esp. slide 24 onward)}}</ref> suggesting that reversing this trend is necessary to reduce emissions.

Part of the difficulty is that when [[Environmental impact of aviation|aviation emissions]] are made at high altitude, the climate impacts are much greater than otherwise. Others have been raising the related concerns of the increasing [[hypermobility (travel)|hypermobility]] of individuals, whether traveling for business or pleasure, involving frequent and often long distance air travel, as well as air shipment of goods.<ref name="gossling">Gössling S, Ceron JP, Dubois G, Hall CM, Gössling IS, Upham P, [[Earthscan]] London (2009).

The chapter: ''[http://alicante.academia.edu/documents/0076/1866/chap06_copy.pdf]''</ref>

===Business opportunities and risks===
{{Main|Business action on climate change}}

On 9 May 2005 [[Jeff Immelt]], the [[chief executive]] of [[General Electric]] (GE), announced plans to reduce GE's global warming related emissions by one percent by 2012. "GE said that given its projected growth, those emissions would have risen by 40 percent without such action."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7791657/ |title=Green Electric? GE unveils eco-strategy publisher=MSNBC}}</ref>

On 21 June 2005 a group of leading [[airline]]s, [[airport]]s and [[aerospace]] [[manufacturer]]s pledged to work together to reduce the negative [[environmental impact of aviation]], including limiting the impact of air travel on climate change by improving [[fuel efficiency]] and reducing carbon dioxide emissions of new aircraft by fifty percent per seat kilometre by 2020 from 2000 levels. The group aims to develop a common reporting system for carbon dioxide emissions per aircraft by the end of 2005, and pressed for the early inclusion of aviation in the [[European Union]]'s carbon emission trading scheme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/747d20ea-e1ff-11d9-bf18-00000e2511c8.html |title=Aviation groups set targets to limit their environmental impact publisher=FT.com}}</ref>

===Legal action===
In some countries, those affected by climate change may be able to sue major producers.  Attempts at litigation have been initiated by entire peoples such as Palau<ref>http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/video/video-paradise-lost/14421/ Palau suing the industrialised countries over global warming</ref> and the Inuit,<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6908719/site/newsweek/ Inuit suing the US in regards to global warming] {{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> as well as non-governmental organizations such as the Sierra Club.<ref>[http://www.newson6.com/story/9138384/environmental-integrity-project-sierra-club-announce-plans-to-sue-epa-unless-it-revises-nitrogen-oxide-emissions-standard-curbs-nitrous-oxide?clienttype=printable Sierra club suing EPA]</ref>  Although proving that particular weather events are due specifically to global warming may never be possible,<ref>Edward Lorenz (1982): "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get"</ref> methodologies have been developed to show the increased risk of such events caused by global warming.<ref>Stott, et al. (2004), "Human contribution to the European heatwave of 2003", Nature, Vol. 432, 2 December 2004</ref>

For a legal action for [[negligence]] (or similar) to succeed, "Plaintiffs ... must show that, more probably than not, their individual injuries were caused by the risk factor in question, as opposed to any other cause. This has sometimes been translated to a requirement of a relative risk of at least two."<ref>Grossman, Columbia J. of Env. Law, 2003</ref> Another route (though with little legal bite) is the [[World Heritage Convention]], if it can be shown that climate change is affecting [[World Heritage Site]]s like [[Mount Everest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=4950&method=full |title=Climate change 'ruining' Everest |publisher=Heatisonline.org |date=2004-11-17 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2004/11/041117_climate-belize.shtml Climate change 'ruining' Belize] BBC November 2004</ref>

Legal action has also been taken to try to force the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]],<ref>[http://www.climatelaw.org/cases Climate Justice] Ongoing Cases</ref> and against the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] and [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation|OPIC]] for failing to assess environmental impacts (including global warming impacts) under [[NEPA]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

According to a 2004 study commissioned by [[Friends of the Earth]], [[ExxonMobil]] and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002. The group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action.<ref>[http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/exxonmobils_contribution_t_28012004.html Exxon Mobile's Contribution to Global Warming Revealed] from Friends of the Earth</ref>
