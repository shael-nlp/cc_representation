is leading to increased effort to develop new technologies and sciences and carefully manage others in an attempt to mitigate global warming.

The [[energy policy of the European Union]] has set a target of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 °C <nowiki>[</nowiki>3.6 °F<nowiki>]</nowiki> compared to [[Industrial Revolution|preindustrial]] levels, of which 0.8 °C has already taken place and another 0.5 °C is already [[Climate commitment|committed]]. The 2 °C rise is typically associated in [[climate model]]s with a [[carbon dioxide]] concentration of 400-500 [[parts per million|ppm]] by volume; the current level as of January 2007 is 383 ppm by volume, and rising at 2 ppm annually. Hence, to avoid a very likely breach of the 2 °C target, CO<sub>2</sub> levels would have to be stabilised very soon; this is generally regarded as unlikely, based on current programs in place to date.<ref>{{cite web

At the core of most proposals is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through reducing energy use and switching to cleaner energy sources. Frequently discussed [[energy conservation]] methods include increasing the [[fuel efficiency]] of vehicles (often through [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]], [[plug-in hybrid]], and [[electric car]]s and [[fuel economy in automobiles|improving conventional automobiles]]), [[Climate change response|individual-lifestyle changes]] and [[business action on climate change|changing business practices]]. [[Future energy development|Newly developed technologies]] and currently available technologies including cleaner fuels such as [[hydrogen fuel cell]]s, [[solar power]], [[nuclear power]], [[Tidal power|tidal]] and [[ocean energy]], [[geothermal power]], and [[wind power]] and the use of [[carbon sink]]s, [[carbon credits]], and [[carbon tax|taxation]] are aimed more precisely at countering continued greenhouse gas emissions. More radical proposals include [[planetary engineering]] techniques ranging from relatively simple [[carbon sequestration]] to orbital [[solar shade]]s and [[population control]], to lessen demand for resources such as energy and land.

have proposed a program to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 1 billion metric tons per year − or 25 billion tons over the 50-year period. The proposed 15 different programs, any seven of which could achieve the goal, are:
# [[efficient vehicle]]s − increase fuel economy from 30 to 60 mpg for 2 billion vehicles,
# reduce use of vehicles − improve urban design to reduce miles driven from 10,000 to 5,000 miles per year for 2 billion vehicles,
# efficient buildings − reduce energy consumption by 25%,
# improve efficiency of coal plants from today's 40% to 60%,
# replace 1,400 gigawatts of coal power plants with natural gas,
# capture and store carbon emitted from 800 gigawatts of new coal plants,
# capture and reuse hydrogen created by #6 above,
# capture and store carbon from coal to syn fuels conversion at {{convert|30|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}},

==Energy efficiency and conservation==
{{main|Energy efficiency|Energy conservation}}

[[Image:World energy intensity by region 1970-2025.png|thumb|[[Developing countries]] use their energy less efficiently than developed countries, getting less [[GDP]] for the same amount of energy.]]
[[Image:EIA2007 f4.jpg|thumb|The [[Energy Information Administration]] predicts world energy usage will rise in the next few decades.]]

Energy which is saved by improvements in efficiency has, in practice, often provided good environmental benefit and provided a net cost saving to the energy user. Building insulation, fluorescent lighting, and public transportation are some of the most effective means of conserving energy, and by extension, the environment.  However, [[Jevons paradox]] poses a challenge to the goal of reducing overall energy use (and thus environmental impact) by energy conservation methods. Improved efficiency lowers cost, which in turn increases demand. To ensure that increases in efficiency actually reduces energy use, a tax must be imposed to remove any cost savings from improved efficiency. 

Energy conservation is the practice of increasing the efficiency of use of energy in order to achieve higher useful output for the same energy consumption. This may result in increase of national security, personal security, financial capital, human comfort and environmental value. Individuals and organizations that are direct consumers of energy may want to conserve energy in order to reduce energy costs and promote environmental values. Industrial and commercial users may want to increase efficiency and maximize profit.

On a larger scale, energy conservation is an element of energy policy. The need to increase the available supply of energy (for example, through the creation of new power plants, or by the importation of more energy) is lessened if societal demand for energy can be reduced, or if growth in demand can be slowed. This makes energy conservation an important part of the debate over climate change and the replacement of non-renewable resources with renewable energy. Encouraging energy conservation among consumers is often advocated as a cheaper or more environmentally sensitive alternative to increased energy production.

===The energy landscape===
Residential buildings, commercial buildings, and the transportation of people and freight use the majority of the energy consumed by the United States each year. Specifically, the industrial sector uses 38 percent of total energy, closely followed by the transportation sector at 28 percent, the residential sector at 19 percent, and the commercial sector at 16 percent. On a community level, transportation can account for 40 to 50 percent of total energy use, and residential buildings use another 20 to 30 percent.<ref>Jim Schwab, "Who'd Got the Energy?" ''Planning'', American Planning Association, October 2002</ref>

In developed nations, the way of life today is completely dependent on abundant supplies of energy. Energy is needed to heat, cool, and light homes, fuel cars, and power offices. Energy is also critical for manufacturing the products used every day, including the cement, concrete and bricks that shape our communities.<ref>{{Citation

While the U.S represents only five percent of the world's population, it consumes 25 percent of its energy and generates about 25 percent of its total greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. citizens, for example, use more energy per capita for transportation than do citizens of any other industrialized nation--which in part, reflects the greater distances traveled by Americans compared with citizens of other nations.<ref>Richard Gilbert, ''Energy and Smart Growth: An Issue Paper'', Neptis, 2002, page 9</ref>

One alarming problem with the close connection between energy and land use is the relative inflexibility of the built environment in relation to energy shifts. Energy availability and pricing are volatile and dependent on changing political and economic factors. While energy shifts can be quick and capricious, land development patterns can be difficult and expensive to alter.

===Urban Planning===
{{main|urban planning}}
[[Urban planning]] also has an effect on energy use. Between 1982 and 1997, the amount of land consumed for [[urban development]] in the United States increased by 47 percent while the nation's population grew by only 17 percent.<ref>{{citation

Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.

At the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These smart growth practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.

Approaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[Transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through [[medium-density]], [[mixed-use]] planning and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book "Sustainability and Cities" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->

Smarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices. {{see also|Smart Growth}}

New buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources. Existing buildings can be made more efficient through the use of insulation, high-efficiency appliances (particularly [[hot water heater]]s and [[furnaces]]), [[insulated glazing|double- or triple-glazed gas-filled windows]], external window shades, and building orientation and siting. Renewable heat sources such as [[geothermal power]] and [[passive solar]] energy reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted. In addition to designing buildings which are more energy efficient to heat, it is possible to design buildings that are more energy efficient to cool by using lighter-coloured, more reflective materials in the development of urban areas (e.g. by painting roofs white) and planting trees.<ref>{{Citation

===Transport===
{{main|Sustainable transport}}
Nowadays [[energy efficiency|energy efficient technologies]], such as [[plug-in hybrid]] electric vehicles,  and  [[future energy development|development of new technologies]], such as [[hydrogen car]]s, may reduce the consumption of [[petroleum]] and emissions of [[carbon dioxide]].

A shift from [[air transport]] and [[road transport|truck transport]] to electric [[rail transport]]
would reduce emissions significantly.<ref>{{cite paper

Increased use of [[biofuel]]s (such as [[biodiesel]] and [[biobutanol]], that can be used in 100% concentration in nowadays diesel and gasoline engines) also reduce emissions, especially in conjunction with regular [[hybrid vehicle|hybrids]] and [[plug-in hybrid]]s. 

For electric vehicles, the reduction of carbon emissions will improve further if the way the required electricity is generated is low-carbon (from [[renewable energy]] sources).

Effective [[urban planning]] to reduce [[Urban sprawl|sprawl]] would decrease Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT), lowering emissions from transportation. Increased use of [[public transport]] can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions per passenger kilometer.

==Alternative energy sources ==
{{Main|Energy development}}
====Nuclear energy====
In some countries there are discussions about the future role of [[nuclear power]] as a possible alternative to fossil fuels. The use of nuclear energy to combat global warming conflicts with some countries' decisions to [[Nuclear_energy_policy#Nuclear_power_phase-out|phase out nuclear power]] for environmental, social, cost and political reasons.

===== Electricity =====
Nuclear provides for 20% of the electricity produces, and hence for approx 6% of [[Energy: world resources and consumption|global energy production]]. The current fleet is already aged, and to maintain the 6% requires a lot of effort from the industry. A scenario where nuclear power would provide a significant reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions would require a nuclear building campaign, which is seen by many as not realistic.

===== Life cycle analysis =====
Some comparisons of life cycle analysis (LCA) of carbon dioxide emissions show nuclear power as equal or better than renewable energy sources<ref>[http://www.uic.com.au/ComparativeCO2.htm Comparative Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Power Generation] AUA Factsheet May 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf100.html Energy Balances and CO2 Implications] World Nuclear Association November 2005</ref> However, in a study, carbon dioxide emissions from nuclear power per kilowatt hour are around 20-40% of those for [[natural gas]]-fired power stations and about 4 or 5 times greater than that produced by some renewable energy sources<ref>(van Leeuwen and Smith, 
Nuclear power – the energy balance)[http://www.stormsmith.nl/]</ref>. This study has been criticized by the [[World Nuclear Association]].<ref>[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf11.html Energy Analysis of Power Systems] World Nuclear Association March 2006</ref>, and rebutted by its authors<ref>(van Leeuwen and Smith 2001-2005)[http://www.stormsmith.nl/report20050803/Rebuttal_WNA.pdf]</ref>.

===== Enrichment =====
The bulk of CO<sub>2</sub> emission from nuclear power plants is generated with coal for the electricity consumed during the [[Enriched uranium|uranium enrichment]] process. This can be eliminated if nuclear power plants themselves generate the electricity required during the uranium enrichment process (already being done in France). In addition, [[Gas centrifuge]] technology has greatly reduced the energy required for enrichment, thus reducing the LCA carbon emissions per kilowatt-hour.

Certain [[gas]] [[cogeneration]] plants are 3-4 times more cost effective than nuclear power for abating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, if all the heat produced were used on site or in a local heating system. (However, nuclear power also produces heat which could be used in similar ways). Costs for windpower and nuclear power are similar one not includes non-internalised costs such as back-up power, [[Nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]], [[Radioactive waste|final waste storage]] or [[third party liability]]<ref>[http://www.oeko.de/service/gemis/files/info/nuke_co2_en.pdf Introduction<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

===== Uranium reserves =====
If all fossil-fuel power stations were replaced by nuclear power stations using current nuclear technologies, there would only be enough uranium to supply them only for 3-4 years.<ref>{{cite web

===== Fast breeders and other alternatives =====
There are a number of alternative nuclear fission technologies, such as [[breeder reactor]]s, ("Generation IV") which could vastly extend fuel supplies if required, but they are not without issues.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Lower-risk [[thorium]] cycles have been demonstrated in the past, but this technology has effectively been stalled by disinterest in all forms of fuel reprocessing.<ref>[http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/348/ New age nuclear] ''Dean, Tim'' Cosmos Magazine April 2006</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.ift.uib.no/~lillestol/Energy_Web/EA.html | title=The Energy Amplifier | quote=A description for the non-specialists | author=Carlo Rubbia | date=January 1996 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.ift.uib.no/~lillestol/Energy_Web/Energy_and_Thorium.html | title=Presentations and Facts on Global Energy Needs and the Energy Amplifier, (EA), an Accelerator driven Nuclear Reactor based on Thorium | accessdate=2008-04-24}}</ref>

[[Nuclear fusion]] is another variant of providing nuclear energy, but it will not provide any mitigation to global warming, as the time horizon for its commercial deployment is expected to be after 2050.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

===== Other nuclear GHG emissions =====
In the past, nuclear energy was a source of other [[Global warming potential|potent greenhouse gases]] such as chloro-hydrocarbons and fluoro-hydrocarbons<ref>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/2587.jsp A nuclear power primer] ''Jan Willem Storm van Leeuwen'' for openDemocracy August 2005</ref>. Most of these emissions were traditionally produced because of leaks in freon cooling systems. Those systems have since switched over to more environmentally friendly cooling gases.<ref>[http://www.uic.com.au/nip43.htm The Nuclear Debate] Nuclear Issues Briefing Paper 43 July 2007</ref>

Because the burning of [[coal]] to produce electricity is a primary cause of global warming, countries are trying to find alternatives to coal. According to the [[BBC]] in 2004, [[France]] shut down its last coal mine because it now gets almost all of its electricity from [[nuclear power]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3651881.stm France closes its last coal mine] BBC April 2004</ref> According to a 2007 story broadcast on [[60 Minutes]], [[nuclear power]] gives France the cleanest air of any industrialized country, and the cheapest electricity in all of Europe,<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/06/60minutes/main2655782.shtml France: Vive Les Nukes] ''Kroft, Steve'' CBS April 2007</ref> but nuclear waste, nuclear danger and energy centralization in nuclear powerplants remain.

====Renewable energy====
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:EU Windmill.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Wind turbine]]s in [[Douglas, South Lanarkshire|Douglas]], [[Central Scotland]]]] -->
{{Main|Renewable energy|Renewable energy development}}

One means of reducing carbon emissions is the [[Future energy development|development of new technologies]] such as [[renewable energy]] such as [[wind power]].  Most forms of renewable energy generate no appreciable amounts of greenhouse gases except for [[biofuel]]s derived from [[biomass]].{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Generally, emissions are a fraction of [[fossil fuel]]-based electricity generation. In some cases, notably with [[hydroelectric dams]]--once thought to be one of the cleanest forms of energy--there are unexpected results. One study shows that a hydroelectric dam in the Amazon has 3.6 times larger greenhouse effect per kW·h than electricity production from oil, due to large scale emission of [[methane]] from decaying organic material.<ref>{{Citation

There are however investigations into [[damless hydro|underwater turbines]] that do not require a dam.

Currently governments subsidize [[fossil fuel]]s by an estimated $235 billion a year.<ref>[http://www.eldis.org/static/DOC15456.htm The price of power: poverty, climate change, the coming energy crisis and the renewable revolution] ''A.

In 2005, Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] promised an initiative to install a [[million solar roofs]] in [[California]].{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

In June 2005, the [[chief executive]] of [[BT Group plc|BT]] allegedly became the first head of a British company to admit that climate change is already affecting his company, and affecting its business, and announced plans<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1517948,00.html On the buses with the leaner, greener BT] ''Curtis, Polly'' The Guardian June 2005</ref> to source much of its substantial energy use from renewable sources. He noted that, ''"Since the beginning of the year, the media has been showing us images of Greenland glaciers crashing into the sea, Mount Kilimanjaro devoid of its ice cap and Scotland reeling from floods and gales. All down to natural weather cycles? I think not"''<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,,1504416,00.html Climate change is costing us, says BT boss] ''Wachman, Richard'' The Observer June 2005</ref>.

====Eliminating Waste Methane====
[[Methane]] is a significantly more powerful greenhouse gas than [[carbon dioxide]].  Burning one molecule of methane generates one molecule of carbon dioxide.  Accordingly, burning methane which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere (such as at oil wells, landfills, coal mines, waste treatment plants, etc.) provides a net greenhouse gas emissions benefit.<ref>[http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp Natural Gas and the Environment] from ''www.naturalgas.org''</ref> However, reducing the amount of waste methane produced in the first place has an even greater beneficial impact, as might other approaches to productive use of otherwise-wasted methane.

In terms of prevention, vaccines are in the works in Australia to reduce significant global warming contributions from [[methane]] released by livestock via [[flatulence]] and eructation.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6431 Burp vaccine cuts greenhouse gas emissions] ''Rachel Nowak'' for NewScientist September 2004</ref>

== Use the fossil fuels that produce the least greenhouse gases ==
[[Natural gas]] (predominantly [[methane]]) produces  less greenhouses gases per energy unit gained than [[oil]] which in turn produces less than [[coal]], principally because coal has a larger ratio of carbon to hydrogen.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} The combustion of natural gas emits almost 30 percent less carbon dioxide than oil, and just under 45 percent less carbon dioxide than coal. In addition, there are also other environmental benefits.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

A study performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of methane emissions from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use strongly outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. Thus the increased use of natural gas in the place of other, dirtier fossil fuels can serve to lessen the emission of greenhouse gases in the United States.<ref>[http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp Natural Gas and the Environment] from ''www.naturalgas.org''</ref>

==Carbon capture and storage==
{{main|Carbon capture and storage}}

'''Carbon capture and storage''' ('''CCS''') is a plan to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate]] climate change by capturing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) from large point sources such as power plants and subsequently storing it away safely instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. Technology for capturing of CO<sub>2</sub> is already commercially available for large CO<sub>2</sub> emitters, such as power plants. Storage of CO<sub>2</sub>, on the other hand is a relatively untried concept and as yet (2007) no powerplant operates with a full carbon capture and storage system.

CCS applied to a modern conventional power plant could reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80-90% compared to a plant without CCS. Capturing and compressing CO<sub>2</sub> requires much energy and would increase the energy needs of a plant with CCS by about 10-40%. This and other system costs is estimated to increase the costs of energy from a power plant with CCS by 30-60% depending on the specific circumstances. 

Storage of the CO<sub>2</sub> is envisaged either in deep geological formations, deep oceans, or in the form of mineral carbonates. Geological formations are currently considered the most promising, and these are estimated to have a storage capacity of at least 2000 [[Gigaton|Gt]] CO<sub>2</sub>. [[IPCC]] estimates that the economic potential of CCS could be between 10% and 55% of the total carbon mitigation effort until year 2100.

In October 2007, the Bureau of Economic Geology at The University of Texas at Austin received a 10-year, $38 million subcontract to conduct the first intensively monitored, long-term project in the United States studying the feasibility of injecting a large volume of CO<sub>2</sub> for underground storage<ref>"Bureau of Economic Geology Receives $38 Million for First Large-Scale U.S. Test Storing Carbon Dioxide Underground" [http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/102407.html]</ref>. The project is a research program of the Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (SECARB), funded by the National Energy Technology Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The SECARB partnership will demonstrate CO<sub>2</sub> injection rate and storage capacity in the Tuscaloosa-Woodbine geologic system that stretches from Texas to Florida. The region has the potential to store more than 200 billion tons of CO2 from major point sources in the region, equal to about 33 years of U.S. emissions overall at present rates. Beginning in fall 2007, the project will inject CO2 at the rate of one million tons per year, for up to 1.5 years, into brine up to {{convert|10000|ft|m}} below the land surface near the Cranfield oil field about {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of Natchez, Mississippi. Experimental equipment will measure the ability of the subsurface to accept and retain CO2.

==Geoengineering==
{{main|Planetary engineering}}

Chapter 28 of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] report ''Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base'' (1992) defined geoengineering as "options that would involve large-scale engineering of our environment in order to combat or counteract the effects of changes in atmospheric chemistry." {{Fact|date=April 2008}}  They evaluated a range of options to try to give preliminary answers to two questions: can these options work and could they be carried out with a reasonable cost. They also sought to encourage discussion of a third question - what adverse side effects might there be. The following types of option were examined: reforestation, increasing ocean absorption of carbon dioxide (carbon sequestration) and screening out some sunlight. NAS also argued "Engineered countermeasures need to be evaluated but should not be implemented without broad understanding of the direct effects and the potential side effects, the ethical issues, and the risks.". {{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Some [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] use this report as an argument when discussing so-called chemical contrails, or [[chemtrails]], as the chapter on mitigation specifically regards large scale spraying of the skies as a possible solution to solving global warming, among others.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

===Carbon sequestration===
{{main|Carbon sequestration}}

[[Carbon dioxide sink|Carbon sequestration]] has been proposed as a method of reducing the amount of [[radiative forcing]].  Carbon sequestration is a term that describes processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere.   A variety of means of artificially capturing and storing carbon, as well as of enhancing natural sequestration processes, are being explored.   The main natural process is [[photosynthesis]] by plants and single-celled organisms.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}  Artificial processes vary, and concerns have been expressed about their long-term effects.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Although they require land, natural sinks can be enhanced by reforestation and afforestation [[carbon offset]]s, which fix carbon dioxide for as little as $0.11 per metric ton{{Fact|date=September 2007}}.  

In practice, artificial capture is likely to be uneconomic unless applied to major sources - in particular, fossil fuel powered power stations. In such cases, costs of energy could well grow by 50%. However, captured CO<sub>2</sub> can be used to force more [[crude oil]] out of [[oil field]]s, as [[Statoil]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] have made plans to do.<ref>Dead link: [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/08/AR2006030801160.html]</ref>  Some proposals have been made to use [[algae]] to capture [[smokestack]] emissions, but this has not reached commercial level yet.

The so-called [[Geritol]] solution to global warming, first proposed by oceanographer [[John Martin (oceanographer)|John Martin]], is a carbon sequestration strategy whimsically named for a tonic advertised to treat the effects of iron-poor blood.  It is motivated by evidence that seeding the oceans with [[iron]] will increase [[phytoplankton]] populations, and thereby draw more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  A report in Nature, 10 October 1996, by K. H. Coale et al, measured the effects of seeding equatorial Pacific waters with iron, finding that 700 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> were fixed by the resulting phytoplankton bloom per 1 gram of iron seeded.<ref>Coale, KH et al.,"A massive phytoplankton bloom induced by an ecosystem-scale iron fertilization experiment in the equatorial Pacific Ocean," Nature 383(6600): 495-501, 10 Oct. 1996.</ref>. Given the US EPA's current estimate of 1.2×10<sup>13</sup> kg of annual atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> surplus, and the current 2006 market asking price of US$ 35/tonne for 65% iron ore fines, less than US$ 800 million worth of iron ore distributed in the equatorial Pacific annually would suffice to entirely offset surplus carbon emissions.

Opponents of this approach argue that fertilizing the ocean is dangerous and lacks any guarantee of efficacy. The original researchers themselves assert that, far from being a panacea for global warming, iron seeding may be entirely ineffective. Among their concerns are that nobody knows where the carbon goes after it is absorbed by phytoplankton.  Instead of being drawn down to the ocean floor and acting as a carbon sink, the carbon could be reabsorbed by the water, effectively negating any initial gain.  They also express concern that any attempt at [[Planetary engineering|geoengineering]] could result in massive, unpredictable changes to the environment.  They point out that, considering the immense damage caused by adding nutrients to lakes and ponds, it would be a logical conclusion that adding nutrients to the ocean would also cause environmental damage.  Large-scale growth in phytoplankton could reduce oxygen levels, creating [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]] where the ocean cannot support marine-life.  They suggest that there is even the possibility that blooms would release more [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] greenhouse gas in the form of methane than it would sequester.<ref>{{Citation

===Solar shades=== 
{{main|Solar shade}}
Some scientists have suggested using [[aerosol]]s and/or sulfate dust to alter the Earth's [[albedo]], or reflectivity, as an emergency measure to increase [[global dimming]] and thus stave off the effects of [[global warming]]. A 0.5% albedo increase would roughly halve the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> doubling. <ref>[http://fermat.nap.edu/openbook/0309043867/html/447.html Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> To create a similar effect, others have proposed building a literal solar shade in space, perhaps at [[Lagrangian point|L1]]. In 1974, Russian expert Mikhail Budyko suggested that if global warming became a problem, we could cool down the planet by burning sulfur in the stratosphere, which would create a haze. [[Paul Crutzen]] suggests that this would cost 25 to 50 billion dollars/year. It would, however, increase the environmental problem of [[acid rain]]<ref>

==Societal Controls==
Another method being examined is to make carbon a new currency by introducing tradeable "Personal Carbon Credits". The idea  being it will encourage and motivate individuals to reduce their 'carbon footprint' by the way they live. Each citizen will receive a free annual quota of carbon that they can use to travel, buy food, and go about their business. It has been suggested that by using this concept it could actually solve two problems; pollution and poverty, old age pensioners will actually be better off because they fly less often, so they can cash in their quota at the end of the year to pay heating bills, etc. <ref>[http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/ministers/speeches/david-miliband/dm060719.htm Defra.co.uk]</ref>

==Governmental and Intergovernmental Action==
{{main|Politics of global warming}}
===Kyoto Protocol===
{{main|Kyoto Protocol}}

The primary international agreement on combating climate change is the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which came into force on [[16 February]] [[2005]].  The Kyoto Protocol is an [[wiktionary:Amendment|amendment]] to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC).  [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|Countries that have ratified this protocol]] have committed to reduce their emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] and five other [[greenhouse gas]]es, or engage in [[emissions trading]] if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases.

===Encouraging use changes===
==== Carbon emissions trading ====
{{main|Carbon emissions trading}}

The [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS) <ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission.htm Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS)] from ''ec.europa.eu''</ref> is the largest multi-national, greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world.  It commenced operation on [[1 January]] [[2005]], and all 25 member states of the [[European Union]] participate in the scheme which has created a new market in carbon dioxide allowances estimated at 35 billion Euros (US$43 billion) per year.<ref>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/2570.jsp The $20,000,000,000,000 question] ''Robins, Nick'' for Opendemocracy</ref> The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] was the first (voluntary) emissions market, and is soon to be followed by Asia's first market ([[Asia Carbon Exchange]]). A total of 107 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent have been exchanged through projects in 2004, a 38% increase relative to 2003 (78 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e).<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/docs/CarbonMarketStudy2005.pdf State and Trends of the Carbon Market] International Emissions Trading Association 2005</ref>

With the creation of a [[market]] for [[carbon emissions trading|trading carbon dioxide emissions]] within the Kyoto Protocol, it is likely that London financial markets will be the centre for this potentially highly lucrative business; the [[NYSE|New York]] and [[Chicago]] stock markets may have a lower trade volume than expected as long as the US maintains its rejection of the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]]).<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,,1509761,00.html How high-pressure politics threatens action on climate] The Observer [[June]] 2005</ref>

Twenty three [[multinational corporation]]s  have come together in the [[G8 Climate Change Roundtable]], a business group formed at the January 2005 [[World Economic Forum]]. The group includes [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Toyota]], [[British Airways]] and [[BP]]. On [[9 June]] [[2005]] the Group published a statement<ref>[http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf Statement of G8 Climate Change Roundtable] Convened by the World Economic Forum June 2005</ref> stating that there was a need to act on climate change and claiming that market-based solutions can help. It called on governments to establish "clear, transparent, and consistent price signals" through "creation of a long-term policy framework" that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases.
<!-- What about the criticisms of the trading scheme? -->

The [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] is a proposed carbon trading scheme being created by nine North-eastern and Mid-Atlantic [[United States|American]] states; [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[Vermont]]. The scheme was due to be developed by April 2005 but has not yet been completed.

====Carbon tax====
{{main|Carbon tax}}

In 1991, [[Sweden]] introduced the world's first carbon tax. The UK has had a [[Climate Change Levy]] on fossil-fuel-based [[electricity generation]] since 2001. Plans for a carbon tax in [[New Zealand]] were abandoned after the 2005 elections.

==Non-governmental approaches==
===Legal action===
In some countries, those affected by climate change may be able to sue major producers, in a parallel to the lawsuits against [[tobacco]] companies.<ref>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-G8/ghost_2640.jsp The ghost of Gleneagles] ''Allen, Myles'' for Opendemocracy January 2005</ref>  Although proving that particular weather events are due specifically to global warming may never be possible<ref>Edward Lorenz (1982): "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get"</ref>, methodologies have been developed to show the increased risk of such events caused by global warming.<ref>Stott, et al. (2004), "Human contribution to the European heatwave of 2003", Nature, Vol. 432, [[2 December]] [[2004]]</ref> 

For a legal action for [[negligence]] (or similar) to succeed, "Plaintiffs … must show that, more probably than not, their individual injuries were caused by the risk factor in question, as opposed to any other cause. This has sometimes been translated to a requirement of a relative risk of at least two."<ref>Grossman, Columbia J. of Env. Law, 2003</ref> Another route (though with little legal bite) is the [[World Heritage Convention]], if it can be shown that climate change is affecting [[World Heritage Site]]s like [[Mount Everest]].<ref>[http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=4950&method=full Climate change 'ruining' Everest]</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2004/11/041117_climate-belize.shtml Climate change 'ruining' Belize] BBC November 2004</ref>

Legal action has also been taken to try to force the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the [[Clean Air Act]],<ref>[http://www.climatelaw.org/cases  Climate Justice] Ongoing Cases</ref> and against the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] and [[OPIC]] for failing to assess environmental impacts (including global warming impacts) under [[NEPA]].{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

According to a 2004 study commissioned by [[Friends of the Earth]], [[ExxonMobil]] and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002. The group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action.<ref>[http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/exxonmobils_contribution_t_28012004.html Exxon Mobile's Contribution to Global Warming Revealed] from Friends of the Earth</ref>

===Personal choices===
While many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.  Environmental groups encourage [[Individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]]. Common recommendations include lowering home heating and cooling usage, burning less gasoline, supporting renewable [[energy sources]], buying local products to reduce transportation, turning off unused devices, and various others.  A [[geophysicist]] at [[Utrecht University]] has urged similar institutions to hold the vanguard in voluntary mitigation, suggesting the use of communications technologies such as [[videoconferencing]] to reduce their dependence on long-haul flights.<ref>

==Business Opportunities and Risks==
In addition to government action and the personal choices individuals can make, the threat posed by global warming provides business opportunities to be exploited and risks to be mitigated.  

There has also been [[business action on climate change]].

On [[9 May]] [[2005]] [[Jeff Immelt]], the [[chief executive]] of [[General Electric]] (GE), announced plans to reduce GE's global warming related emissions by one percent by 2012. "GE said that given its projected growth, those emissions would have risen by 40 percent without such action." <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7791657/ |title=Green Electric? GE unveils eco-strategy publisher=MSNBC}}</ref> 

On [[21 June]] [[2005]] a group of leading [[airline]]s, [[airport]]s and [[aerospace]] [[manufacturer]]s pledged to work together to reduce the negative [[environmental impact]] of the [[aviation industry]], including limiting the impact of air travel on climate change by improving [[fuel efficiency]] and reducing carbon dioxide emissions of new aircraft by fifty percent per seat kilometre by 2020 from 2000 levels. The group aims to develop a common reporting system for carbon dioxide emissions per aircraft by the end of 2005, and pressed for the early inclusion of aviation in the [[European Union]]'s carbon emission trading scheme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/747d20ea-e1ff-11d9-bf18-00000e2511c8.html |title=Aviation groups set targets to limit their environmental impact publisher=FT.com}}</ref>

==Territorial policies of mitigation==
{{See also|List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions}}

=====The US and global warming mitigation=====

Transportation Secretary Mary Peters, with White House approval, urged governors and dozens of members of the House of Representatives to block California’s first-in-the-nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks, according to e-mails obtained by Congress.<ref>[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/09/25/4099/ "How the White House Worked to Scuttle California’s Climate Law"], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], September 25, 2007</ref>.

=====US attempts to suppress science of global warming=====
The U.S. government has pressured American scientists to suppress discussion of global warming, according to the testimony of the Union of Concerned Scientists to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives.<ref>Reuters, January 30, 2007, free archived version at http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0130-10.htm, last visited Jan. 30, '07</ref><ref>Written testimony of Dr. Grifo before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf</ref> "High-quality science" was "struggling to get out," as the Bush administration pressured scientists to tailor their writings on global warming to fit the Bush administration's skepticism, in some cases at the behest of an ex-oil industry lobbyist. "Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change,' 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications."

{{Main|European Climate Change Programme}}

== Mitigation in developing countries==
In order to reconcile [[economic development]] with mitigating carbon emissions, [[developing countries]] need particular support, both financial and technical. One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.

In July 2005 the U.S., China, India, Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, agreed to the [[Asia-Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate]]. The pact aims to encourage technological development that may mitigate global warming, without coordinated emissions targets. The highest goal of the pact is to find and promote new technology that aid both growth and a cleaner environment simultaneously. An example is the Methane to Markets initiative which reduces methane emissions into the atmosphere by capturing the gas and using it for growth enhancing clean energy generation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_partnerships/gda/methanetomarkets.htm |title=Methane to Markets Partnership |publisher=USAID.gov}}</ref> Critics have raised concerns that the pact undermines the Kyoto Protocol.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7744 |title=US-led emissions pact seen as Kyoto rival |publisher=NewScientist.com}}</ref> 

However, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions.  Critics of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.

==Population Control==
The [[Overpopulation|population explosion]] is a fundamental factor that has led to global warming.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Because of this, various organizations promote [[population control]] as a means for mitigating global warming.<ref>[http://www.sierraclub.org/population/reports/globalwarming.asp Population and Global Warming Factsheet] from Sierra Club</ref><ref>[http://www.nwf.org/popandenvironment/globalwarming.cfm Population and Global Warming] National Wild Life Federation</ref><ref>[http://www.populationconnection.org/Communications/FactSheets/Pop%20and%20Env%202002.pdf Population and the Environment Fact SHeet] Population Connection</ref><ref>[http://www.populationconnection.org/About_Us/policies.html Population Connection]  Statement of Policy</ref>  Proposed measures include improving access to [[family planning]] and [[reproductive health]] care and information, reducing [[natalistic politics]], public education about the consequences of continued population growth, and improving access of women to education and economic opportunities.

Population control efforts are impeded by their being somewhat of a taboo in some countries against considering any such efforts.<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/315/7120/1441 To the point of farce: a martian view of the hardinian taboo—the silence that surrounds population control] Maurice King, Charles Elliott BMJ</ref>  Also, various religions [[Religious views on birth control|discourage or prohibit]] some or all forms of [[birth control]].

Population size has a different per capita effect on global warming in different countries, since the per capita production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases varies greatly by country.<ref>[http://www.sierraclub.org/population/factsheets/pop_and_globalwarming.asp Who is Heating Up the Planet? A Closer Look at Population and Global Warming] from Sierra Club</ref>
